subject re possible visit to enron by professor nalin kulatilaka of boston university hi iris i have two different hats to wear in talking to enron one is as a financial economist the other as the director of the newly formed global mobility innovation initiative gmii this is the research project funded by lucent involving bu lbs and insead to study various aspects of the mobile internet read 3 g on the former i am working with a couple of ph d students in understanding a details of how having physical supply inventory can be used by a market maker this is a problem that has been studies in the context of specialists inventory in the stock market but i think really interesting in the way enron does it in some of the newer markets like bandwidth i think this is a big issue in lighting up all the dark fiber that is in the ground b how enron is disciplining the internal decision making process with market this is in many ways the critical aspect of real options that most finance people miss having options is one thing but exercising them and realizing their value is another all of the incomplete contracting asymmetric information and incentive issues are ignored in real options valuation models but they are real in practice my impression is enron s real success is in putting place an organization that is able to mitigate these problems by imposing a market disciplining c how enron manages the various books that involve physicals financials credit etc this is specially important when many of the real assets have options features and therefore include non linear risk profiles the story of gas is pretty well understood but not many of the others markets enron has been moving into over the last few years on the gmii front i think that some interesting opportunities arise when you think of the spectrum in a way similar to that of dark fiber i am working with several people at lucent on this issue i think it would be wonderful to engage in a conversation with enron and lucent folks in the room i can do a lunch time talk on any of these issues perhaps we can discuss some of these over a conference call clearly having vince kaminski in the room would be very important to me as for schedules the first 3 weeks of april are horrible april 26 27 may 3 4 are good for me regards nalin at 06 56 pm 03 22 2001 mack iris wrote hi as we briefly discussed i spoke

subject pserc denver meeting vince the pserc meeting lance and i went to was both interesting and boring pserc has 11 school members and 30 industry members its research program consists of three stems markets transmission and distribution and systems enron s interests probably lie mainly in the first stem in morning of the first day researchers from universities presented their project proposals i found some of them quite interesting for example shmuel oren fernando alvarado tim mount of cornell propose to study market redesign incorporating the lessons learned from actual experiences for enhancing market design shijie deng s oren et al propose to study power asset valuation model in a market based and reliability constrained electric power system the first got funded but the second did not in the same afternoon industry and academic separated to have their own discussion i went to the academic discussion and lance the industry one i hope my presence there did not make things worse for the discussion revealed a lot of organizational chaos and confusion the proposal screen process got a lot of heat from participants the proposal process goes as follows researchers first write a short proposal to appropriate stem committee no industry participantion it seems to me each committee then ranks the proposal and selects the top 3 or 4 the selected proposals are then expanded to be present to the industry industry then gets to vote which proposals get funded however some researchers were very unhappy about the initial ranking and selection process there were accusation of self ranking communication between stem committee and member schools breaking down and so on some were even asking for some sort of assurance that the project will be funded even before wrting it the arguement was then it was a waste of our time to write proposals which i found quite amusing all in all i found the process was not taken seriously enough by university researchers pserc has been established for 5 years now and it still does not have a proper proposal screen process which is hard to believe also the communication among university researchers between stem committee and member schools and most importantly between researchers and industry are not smooth as all since the proposals are voted by 30 or so industry members the right projects may not get funded too many participants also make the decision process very indecisive and quite painful to watch lance can comment on this better they also wanted to spread the fund among all schools which made the voting a less authoritive i believe enron will not get much returns from join pserc price tag is 40 000 per company per year if we find some projects interesting we can sponsor the schools in the form of summer interns the schools claim that most of the fund goes to support students anyway alex,0

subject ees operational risk per our conversation here is the model that i have for simon the notes that i gave you were from some work i did back in september as i was looking for volume numbers the notes show what drives the final cash flow numbers briefly the issue surrounds exactly what is meant by nonmarket and noncredit risk ideally this would be anything that effects npv of the deal however i think that we should limit ourselves to those things that effect the time and amount of the eam volumes even here such a problem set is quite large if you glance at the spreadsheet model you will notice that there exists a large number of possible items that effect the eam volumes if we are to do this rigorously then it is necessary to tear apart ees s business model and although such an attempt to do so would be noble the scope of such an excercise may be too large we need a clear definition of ees operational risk briefly from the ees deals that i have looked at two things drive their profit a long term bet that power prices will go down and that we can improve the facility through various enhancements each of these may be gleaned from the spreadsheet as well as the assumptions regarding the funding of the facility improvements and so on 95 of the savings is assumed to come from power and 5 from gas the effeciency gain may not be explicitly given if we have data that show the realized efficiency gains then it would be simple in principle to determine a distribution and hence a distribution of eam volumes npv s etc at this time i understand that rac has determined some of the realized efficiency gains but my knowledge is quite sketchy jay hachen may have more info if i get a chance i will try to see if i can do a proof of concept excercise but i have a late january deadline on something else another point even if we are successful in doing this for the spreadsheet model ees has chosen to book things differently i do not have a thorough understanding of their it systems but at least in principle if we can do this for the spreadsheet model then we can do it in their it environment data are data are data they may book efficiency gains through improvement type such as gains due to compressors chillers boilers etc if this is indeed the case then we need to have distributions for each type of improvement if we are successful on the spreadsheet and not successful with their it systems then the other alternative is to build our own reporting system it would be similar to a database where the recordsets are replaced by excel workbooks it can be constructed in such a way as to enable us to run simulations and queries but this would probably take me about five or six weeks finally don hawkins does operational audits for enron s physical assets he sends out teams to audit our pipelines and strategic assets i don t think that he does it for ees but you might want to give him a call anyway kevin k ps the ees lunch meeting has been moved to wednesdays jay hachen will know more,0

focuses on producing educational material about network measurement and on developing new metrics these were the two areas of greatest interest amongst the caida members the wg co chairs are sue moon sprintlabs and brett watson mfn abovenet you are invited to attend the first wg meeting the agenda is as follows agenda for caida wg meeting on thursday 2 mar 00 10 am 4 pm abovenet downtown sjc see below for details 1 review wg charter is it reasonable as set out in the draft what should be removed or added 2 work through revised charter in detail identify the work required for each part determine who s willing to work on it attempt to determine delivery times 3 discussion of new metrics first attempt at making a list of metrics to be considered 4 anything else location abovenet is

only application vs transport layer rating schemes provider net performance pages internet weather map s keynote etc publish as caida web pages or maybe as an info rfc survey paper on metrics and internet measurement current measurement efforts surveyor ripe test traffic amp iperf at t keynote skitter current tools publish as caida web pages 2 service metrics define new metrics taxonomy of current metrics ippm rtfm itu summary of metrics used for current services gather information ideas about new emerging services especially diffserv based ones make list of new metrics either to improve measurement of existing services or to support new ones list of metrics questions appendix a goes here organise experimental implementation testing of tools for new metrics make recommendations on implementation define core set of really useful metrics recommend that caida implement these as a service measurement toolkit publish new metric definitions through ippm or rtfm produce document measurement requirements for hardware software vendors publish on caida web pages appendix a questions from the earlier draft caida wg charters a what types of network and transport layer metrics are being used by isps in engineering and operating their networks by customers for verifying service guarantees b what new services are being or are likely to be offered e g diffserv is there a need for higher layer metrics to better monitor and manage these services c will these new differentiated transport and application layer services need new metrics d how can the service metrics be measured in a multi isp environment e how can customers verify these measurements f what requirements would service measurement introduce for equipment vendors g how relevant are specific techniques e g which flow and points of measurement to specific users isp customer etc requirements h how do these metrics relate to network behavior as perceived by users how do they correlate with performance appendix b background on the ietf working groups rtfm wg realtime traffic flow measurement rtfm is concerned with passive measurements of two way traffic flows specified in terms of their end point attributes its primary goal was to produce an improved traffic flow measurement model considering at least the following needs a wider range of measurable quantities e g those relating to ipv 6 and to class of service b simpler ways to specify flows of interest c better ways to control access to measured flow data d strong focus on data reduction capabilities e efficient hardware implementation ippm wg ip performance measurement the ippm wg charter is to develop a set of standard metrics that can be applied to the quality performance and reliability of internet data delivery services these metrics will be designed such that they can be performed by network operators end users or independent testing groups it is important that the metrics not represent a value judgement i e define good and bad but rather provide unbiased quantitative measures of performance rfcs framework for ip performance metrics rfc 2330 metrics connectivity rfc 2678 one way delay rfc 2679 one way packet loss rfc 2680 round trip delay rfc 2681 i ds bulk transfer capacity 2 x instantaneous packet delay variation one way loss patterns other wgs the rmonmib wg is thinking about application performance measurement this is clearly a hard problem e g does this just mean response time measurement can it be done by passive means how should the measurements be presented etc in short rtfm provides a good distributed measuring system for traffic volumes ippm has concentrated on transport layer behaviour of the current best effort internet rmonmib is beginning to consider application layer measurement end of forwarded message,0

subject info you requested kcc thank you for your interest judgment coursesoffers an extensive training course in how to collect moneyjudgments if you are like many people you are not even sure what a money judgment is and why processing money judgments can earn you very substantial income if you ever sue a company or a person and you win then you will have a money judgment against them you are happy you won but you will soon find out the shocking fact its now up to you to collect on the judgment the court does not require the loser to pay you the court will not even help you you must trace the loser down find their assets their employment bank accounts real estate stocks and bonds etc very few people know how to find these assets or what to do when they are found the result is that millions of judgments are just sitting in files and being forgotten in 79 of the cases the winner of a judgment never sees a dime the non payment of judicial debt has grown to epidemic proportions right now in the united states there is between 200 and 300 billion dollars of uncollectedmoney judgment debt for every judgment that is paid 5 more judgments take its place we identified this massive market 8 years ago and have actively pursued judicial judgments since we invented this business we have perfected it into a well proven and solid profession in which only a select few will be trained in the techniques necessary to succeed with our first hand experience we have built a course which teaches you how to start your business in this new unknown and exciting field of processing money judgments by following the steps laid out in our course and with reasonable effort you can become very successful in the processing of money judgments the income potential is substantial in this profession we have associates who have taken our course and are now working full time making 96 000 00 to over 200 000 00 per year part time associates are earning between 24 000 00 and 100 000 00 per year some choose to operateout of their home and work by themselves others build a sizable organization of 15 to 25 people in attractive business offices today our company and our associates have over 126 million dollars in money judgments that we are currently processing of this 126 million 25 million is in the form of joint ventures between our firm and our associates joint ventures are where we make our money we only break even when our course is purchased we make a 12 margin on the reports we supply to our associates our reporting capability is so extensive that government agencies police officers attorneys credit agencies etc all come to us for reports many of our associates already have real estate liens in force of between 5 million to over 15 million dollars legally this means that when the properties are sold or refinanced our associate must be paid off the norm is 10 interest compounded annually on unpaid money judgments annual interest on 5 million at 10 translates to 500 000 00 annually in interest income not counting the payment of the principal our associates earn half of this amount or 250 000 00 per year this is just for interest not counting principle and not counting the compounding of the interest which can add substantial additional income typically companies are sold for 10 times earnings just based on simple interest an associate with 5 million in real estate liens could sell their business for approximately 2 5 million dollars 92 of all of our associates work out of their home 43 are women and 36 are part time one of the benefits of working in this field is that you are not under any kind of time frame if you decide to take off for a month on vacation then go the judgments you are working on will be there when you return the judgments are still in force they do not disappear the way we train you is non confrontational you use your computer and telephone to do most of the processing you never confront the debtor the debtor doesn t know who you are you are not a collection agency simply stated the steps to successful money processing are as follows mail our recommended letter to companies and individuals with money judgments we train you how to find out who to write to 8 to 11 of the firms and people you write will call you and ask for your help they call you you don t call them unless you want to you send them an agreement supplied in the course to sign which splits every dollar you collect 50 to you and 50 to them this applies no matter if the judgment is for 2 000 00 or 2 000 000 00 you then go on line to our computers to find the debtor and their assets we offer over 120 powerful reports to assist you they range from credit reports from all three credit bureaus to bank account locates employment locates skip traces and locating stocks and bonds etc the prices of our reports are very low typically 1 2 to 1 3 of what other firms charge for example we charge 6 00 for an individuals credit report when some other companies charge 25 00 once you find the debtor and their assets you file garnishments and liens on the assets you have located standard fill in the blanks forms are included in the course when you receive the assets you keep 50 and send 50 to the original judgment holder once the judgment is fully paid you mail a satisfaction of judgment to the court included in the course quote s from several of our students thomas in area code 516 writes us i just wanted to drop you a short note thanking you for your excellent course my first week part time will net me 3 700 00 dollars your professionalism in both the manual and your support you have the video opened doors for me in the future there s no stopping me now recently thomas states he has over 8 500 000 worth of judgments he is working on after only having this course for four months larry s in area code 314 stated to us i am now making 2 000 00 per week and expect this to grow to twice this amountwithin the next year i am having a ball i have over 250 000 in judgments i am collecting on now after having our course for 7 months larry s in 314 stated i am now making 12 000 00 per month and have approximately 500 000 00 in judgments i am collecting on looks like i will have to hire someone to help out marshal in area code 407 states to us i feel bad you only charged me 259 00 for this course and it is a goldmine i

subject nytimes com article the real wolf this article from nytimes com has been sent to you by vkaminski aol com advertisement looking for better it solutions toshiba is uniting digital mobile and network innovations in a bold new vision of information technology for today and tomorrow take a closer look at life in the new digital age and imagine how good it can be visit toshiba com for more details the real wolf reckonings by paul krugman ecently i received a letter from an economist i respect chiding me for my naderite columns on the california energy crisis he just didn t believe that market manipulation by power companies could possibly be an important issue it sounded too much to him like the sort of thing one hears from knee jerk leftists who blame greedy capitalists for every problem be it third world poverty or high apartment rents the left has cried wolf so many times that sensible people have learned to discount such claims but now a bona fide wolf has arrived whose predatory behavior is doing terrible damage to our most populous state  and nobody will believe it true california would be heading for a summer of power shortages even if it had never deregulated and even if there was workable competition in the wholesale electricity market prices in that market would spike during periods of peak demand transferring billions of dollars from either taxpayers or consumers to the generators but the evidence is now overwhelming that there isn t workable competition in california s power market and that the actions of generators gaming the system have greatly magnified the crisis the key fact is that california has somehow remained in a state of more or less continuous power shortage and very high wholesale prices regardless of the level of demand a rash of outages has kept the electricity market conveniently  and very profitably  short of supply even during periods of low demand when there ought to be lots of excess capacity as frank wolak the stanford economist who also advises the state s power grid has pointed out an outage at a power plant is a lot like an employee calling in sick you can t tell directly whether he is really sick or has chosen to take the day off for other reasons but you can look for circumstantial evidence and such evidence has convinced mr wolak that generators use forced outages strategically to withhold capacity from the market  a view shared by a growing number of other researchers which brings us to the latest move by the federal energy regulatory commission on wednesday the commission apparently decided to offer california some relief and put new price caps in place on the california electricity market i say apparently because the more you look at the plan the less likely it seems to be any help at all indeed the measure was passed on a 2 to 1 vote with william massey  the one commissioner who has been sympathetic to calls for price controls  voting against it on the grounds that it would be ineffectual what s wrong with ferc s plan first it caps prices only in emergency conditions  ignoring the fact that electricity prices have stayed at hard to explain levels even when there is no emergency in effect the plan is laid out as if the electricity market were really competitive in spite of all the evidence that it is not second even those emergency price caps are full of loopholes offering extensive opportunities for what mr wolak calls megawatt laundering  selling power to affiliated companies that for one reason or another are exempted from the price controls for example the controls do not apply to imports from neighboring states then selling it back into the california market severin borenstein of the university of california energy institute adds that because the allowed price depends on the cost of generation at the least efficient plant generators will have a clear incentive to produce inefficiently i predict we will find some plants we never heard of before that are suddenly operating again and they will be pretty inefficient the general verdict seems to be that this is not a serious plan there are serious proposals to mitigate the crisis out there  indeed last fall mr wolak submitted a proposal that was well received by other experts  but ferc has ignored all of them the charitable interpretation is that ferc still doesn t get it that it just can t bring itself to believe that this time the wolf is real the uncharitable interpretation is that last week s action was meant to fail the medley report an online newsletter calls the ferc plan a grand exercise in posturing without substance a very clever temporary move by the bush administration to deflect any political fallout from the looming disaster whatever the explanation the plain fact is that ferc and the administration have yet to offer california any significant relief 00 fo 04 b 3 blabf visit nytimes com for complete access to the most authoritative news coverage on the web

subject dhabol jeff we shall forward to you shortly a copy of the message from sandeep with the numbers you have requested what follows below are the extracts from two recent articles on the power situation in india published by the financial times the first article describes recent power outage in northern india affecting millions of people one possible line of defense is pointing out to the value of output lost due to power shortages it is obvious that the value of lost production exceeds the cost of power produced by the dhabol plant expensive as it may be the power cut affected 230 million people the second article is enron specific vince asia pacific power failure hits north india financial times jan 3 2001 by angus donald tens of millions of people were left without electricity in northern india yesterday after a power grid breakdown electricity was gradually switched on in some areas and most parts of the capital new delhi with 60 to 70 per cent of supply expected to be restored by the end of the day according to power grid officials the associated chambers of commerce and industry assocham a leading business organisation expressed deep concern and called for a mechanism to prevent future disruption that could cripple the economy the power failure across eight indian states including new delhi disrupted train services water supplies and the telephone network and forced hospitals to switch to emergency generators the fault occurred on the northern grid which provides electricity for 226 m people and affected the states of delhi haryana punjab uttar pradesh himachal pradesh madhya pradesh rajasthan and jammu and kashmir a breakdown at a sub station in kanpur in uttar pradesh india s most populous state caused an overload of power on other lines which then failed as well trains stopped running for most of the day and signals systems were damaged new delhi international airport was also slightly affected before its own power supply could be engaged we will probe into the reasons for the failure it is most likely to be a technical failure but we will investigate why it happened suresh prabhu the power minister was quoted as saying by press trust of india india suffers regularly from power problems because of lack of funding to upgrade infrastructure theft of supplies is also a big problem thirty per cent of the country s electricity is stolen according to analysts in new delhi as much as 50 per cent is stolen two years ago a power failure blacked out uttar pradesh and delhi for hours assocham issued a statement saying that increasing industrial demand would exacerbate the problems already faced by india s inefficient power sector the slow progress particularly in strengthening the transmission and distribution system and ever increasing theft will contribute to worsening the power supply situation further copyright the financial times limited copyright the financial times limited 2000 ft and financial times are trademarks of the financial times privacy policy terms jan 3 2001 by khozem merchant enron the us energy producer and a constant target of criticism in india is hitting back with a campaign to reverse its image as a profiteering multinational its myth and reality offensive in local newspapers follows the west indian state of maharashtra s decision to review the tariff it pays the texas based company whose dollars 2 2 bn electricity generating plant at dabhol is india s biggest single foreign investment maharashtra s tariff has more than doubled since 1993 and is three times greater than that charged by other independent power producers ipps the tariff has risen because of the depreciation of the rupee against the dollar and the high but now falling price of naphtha fuel the state also pays a fixed capacity charge of rs 970 m dollars 21 m a month reflecting the huge project cost and controversially irrespective of consumption a showdown looks inevitable reminiscent of a clash six years ago that damaged india s appeal to foreign investors a former official of the world bank which has criticised the deal says enron is emerging as the east india company of the 21 st century a reference to the british trader that colonised key areas of the indian economy in the 19 th century the stand off is the latest blot on india s power sector the uk s powergen and cogentrix of the us have quit india recently frustrated by long approval procedures inadequate payments mechanisms or because of higher returns elsewhere india has lost time and opportunity and has driven returns down by six percentage points says gerry grove white former india general manager of powergen which has sold its 655 mw plant in gujarat to china light power of hong kong india s national plan for the five years to 2002 says generating capacity must rise by 40 000 mw to about 120 000 mw but since 1992 ipps have added only 3 000 mw and 2 500 mw remains under construction this is insufficient to support official projections of 6 to 8 per cent economic growth enron was a bellwether of india s liberalisation winning fast track project approval in the early 1990 s phase 1 a 740 mw plant fuelled by expensive naphtha came on stream in may 1999 and phase 2 a dollars 1 87 bn plant of 1 624 mw capacity that will run on cheaper liquefied natural gas lng will be completed this year only two of seven other fast track proposals have achieved financial closure from the outset enron encountered attacks culminating in maharashtra s then nationalist government cancelling the project before renegotiating terms no less onerous vilasrao deshmukh chief minister of the successor government says the power purchase agreement is unaffordable enron whose attackers also include cultural chauvinists wants to maintain good political relations in a hostile but lucrative environment enron views india as a testing ground for its evolution from a traditional manager of power plants to a broad based trader of commodities such as energy gas and bandwidth to support these ambitions enron hopes to trade energy between power surplus and deficit states once legislation is passed this year it is building an lng terminal and pipelines to trade imported natural gas and it is laying a 15 000 km fibre optic network to trade bandwidth space in a country desperately short of this new economy commodity in any event enron believes it has a watertight contract it is supported by many that believe any subversion of the contract would confirm investor perception of maharashtra india s financial and industrial hub as an unreliable destination for investment mr deshmukh who has avoided the language of his predecessor which threatened to dump dabhol into the arabian sea is under pressure from radical members of his wobbly coalition but his options are limited scrapping the project would be ruinous for an economically troubled state that would have to compensate shareholders maharashtra state electricity board the local utility and enron s main client is obliged to dispatch or off take 90 per cent of dabhol s output yet mseb has never honoured these guarantees its off take has averaged 60 per cent since the plant opened and in effect mseb has been paying a lot more while consuming a lot less power one reason off take is low is because the state s tough new regulator has told mseb to buy from cheaper sources enron says the tariff would be rs 4 02 kwh if mseb s off take averaged 90 per cent but with off take a third lower the average tariff is rs 4 94 per unit and often higher in october the tariff was rs 6 91 per unit when off take was about 49 per cent enron says tariffs should come down when phase 2 run on cheaper lng starts these cost pressures have forced mseb to take up only half of a 30 per cent equity option in phase 2 enron has acquired the balance and mandated bankers to find a buyer enron s difficulties have undermined the appeal of ipps which have failed to deliver the flood of investments potential ipps feared they would never be paid by state generating boards that have become a byword for corrupt management of power reform of state electricity boards whose uneconomic pricing means industrial users subsidise poor farmers as well as transmission and distribution t d services to check huge theft and technical losses is overdue given the limited resources money would be better spent on t d rather than on new plant says oliver blackaby managing director of n m rothschild in india which is advising karnataka on the privatisation of its distribution network for the moment attention is fixed on enron s ability to satisfy the competing interests of investors and clients as sanjay bhatnagar chief executive officer of enron india said in a recent trade magazine one of the key lessons learned from phase 2 is having flexibility to deal with externalities copyright the financial times limited copyright the

subject introduction vince as way of introduction i wanted to write a bit about mars inc and then about cds the unit i head mars is a private company considered to be the largest privately owned manufacturing company in the world mars is not in the habit of disclosing its finances so the best i could do is refer to forbes estimate of 15 billion annual revenue and to the profit margins of similar companies between 5 12 mars is in the business of manufacturing confectionery m m dove bar skittles twix all r food uncle ben rice r pet food pedigree whiskas waltham r and other products mars has prospered during the years because of a unique philosophy that emphasizes the long term goals of the company part of the philosophy is to look for win win solutions with its suppliers customers and partners as can be understood from the nature of the company a large chunk of its expenses goes towards purchasing commodity like products and hence the history of researching those commodities and the weather that influences their supply and the demand people eat less ice cream in the winter and less chocolate in the summer cds has a history of few decades in forecasting weather and has been very successful with an envious track record in helping mars get a competitive advantage in these arenas cds is a global group in 4 countries across two continents which supports the purchasing function and the corporate at large in these and other arenas it is a multidiscipline and multinational team with a lot to offer not having a ready access to the energy markets and with a risk profile based on manufacturing expertise mars has decided to look for potential partners in this area enron presence in the market place certainly makes it an interesting party to talk to in talking to enron we are careful to suggest that mars is not committing to anything at this point and all we are after is to find out if there is an interest to pursue the opportunity we discussed in the future i am looking forward to our video conference call kind regards avi avi i hauser phd mba cds director 100 international drive mt olive nj 07828 1383 1 973 691 3664 office 1 973 347 8189 fax 1 973 727 3622 car slow paging hauser cdsusa com,0

subject credit applicatiions in grms this note is from ted murphy not bjorn hagelman my understanding is that yet another meeting has been scheduled with the intent of diverting resources from the grms project to some other project while i am not privy to the urgency of this other project i do know that we have a very large multi phase project going in grms grms stands for the global risk monitoring system it is not intended to be a commercial trading product not is its primary purpose for commercial decision making conceptually it is a risk warehouse for the primary purpose of rac due to the deficiency of current front office trading systems and their inability to provide timely aggregated information useful to rac rac has spent over a year developing a business plan scope and detailed task list to accomplish its objectives as a firm we are woefully behind our press clippings in our ability to aggregate and understand our risk profile my most recent sojorn in europe is a classic example of the current systems inabilty to aggregate and meet the needs of rac having abetted poor decision making and causing cash losses in well in excess of the grms budget or that of the market risk group in rac the grms project is a requirement that bill bradford and i have in order to do our jobs we have delegated authority to debbie brackett and rudi zipter to make decisions regarding priorities and as such meet regularly with jonathon and his team as well as rick buy to provide updates while progress is never as fast as we would like it in every instance in which we have only to rely on rac jonathon s team and research to make a deadline it haas been hit the primary reason for any delays whatsoever has been the diversion of resources off the project or the reliance for cooperation from some other source most recently the it staff in london was a tremendous impediment to deadlines please excuse the frustration that is apparently coming through in this note but i feel like the boy with his finger in the dyke and no one is listening also i have had several employees come to resignation over their frustration on the lack of management support for this project usually manifesting itself in the lack of resources or the diversion of resources devoted to it i think we have proven collectively that we can organize a modular multiphase project and provide tangible deliverables when not distracted please let us do our jobs i do not denigrate the efforts of others but i believe that they must either submit their detailed requirements to us for our consideration of their worthiness to put in our que or develop their own project with their own resources thank you for your consideration of this opinion as it relates to things that will effect the ability of market risk to do its job please consult me as i would you ted,0

subject material for thu 2 mar wg meeting fyi forwarded by ravi thuraisingham enron communications on 02 29 00 01 15 pm nevil ipn caida org 02 28 00 10 35 pm to metrics caida org cc bcc ravi thuraisingham enron communications subject material for thu 2 mar wg meeting hello all appended below you ll find a summary of ideas that people have contributed since we at caida began to get the metrics wg started some of this material has already appeared on the metrics mailing list the older material comes from personal emails i m posting it again to give us all some more ideas to think about for those who are able to attend the wg meeting in san jose this thursday 2 mar i d like to spend time in the morning getting to know about attendees interests and experience in making internet measurements i suggest that a good way to do this would be to have each group give a short 10 minutes response times and this gets even more interesting you only need to be able to see traffic in one direction from client to server to get a fairly accurate round trip time from the client to the server irrespective of how far away the client is from your measurement host because of tcps three way handshake for connection establishment when you see the opening syn you wait for the client to ack the server s syn ack and you have the client server round trip time i think you ve actually already done some of this we could also potentially try to correlate dns queries and tcp connections perhaps determining some probabilities in a given environment of a host initiating a tcp connection to a host for which it just received an a record and track various application level response times i d personally love to have a lot of data on the ratio of dns response time to tcp transfer time for http connections even if the measurement makes no attempt to discern what constitutes a web transaction to the user a full page usually many tcp connections anyway i think there are some fairly interesting things we can measure with simple techniques these are just some simple ones there may be some interesting things we could do by digging into payloads of a few of the other highly utilized applications but doing it for tcp is a nightmare perfomance wise but we now have the basic infrastructure to do things with dns over udp we can probably cover any open udp protocol without incurring performance penalties that would make it completely unusable snmp for example while its application is limited network service providers would find round trip time information for snmp packets from their network management stations to agents very useful i think there are some rudimentary things we can do with tcp as well and i also think some sites would be interested in having some rudimentary information for example a weighted by traffic round trip time distribution for tcp traffic to from all networks with which you communicated say at 24 granularity this gives sites a notion of how close they are to those they talk to most frequently with a little more work we could probably make reasonable bandwidth estimates for every end network for which we see tcp data we could certainly get a reasonable number for the maximum observed bandwidth these methods also decouple the measurement from the traffic while we all know the value of that i think it s significant in that active probers can be run on the same host decoupled from the actual measurement and with timestamps coming from kernel space bpf i ve been thinking about this for a long time because eventually i d like skitter and other tools to be able to do use tcp packets for probing with no need for things like ip firewall code if i can just properly time non blocking connects and count on the passive tool to see the syn and syn ack i can use any tcp port for round trip time measurements and not trick my kernel by sending tcp packets on a raw socket i need feedback from the passive tool for tracing like skitter it needs to know when a reply has been seen from a hop and when the destination has been reached but it s not difficult simple bytestream oriented ipc is sufficient going further i like the idea proposed by some others maybe funded at this point i m not tracking it of instrumenting the freenix tcp ip stacks a lot of useful information could be pulled from the stack but eventually someone s going to have to come up with what pieces of information are desirable enough for someone to want their stack instrumented and it ll have to be somewhere between what s currently implemented and a full blown metering system like rtfm and i think in the interim there are a lot of things we could do using libpcap on our local machines non promiscuous and in user space safe easy to implement and test to me the benefits here are a user is likely to have a tangible well understood relationship with their workstation understood by them this is particularly true for those of us with network expertise so it s at least plausible that we can find correlations of measurements with user experience in a fairly short period of time helping us hone in on what s useful even if we only find weak correlations for whatever reason once a correlation exists more people will be interested in helping with development because it ll be something they ll use personally we re essentially guaranteed to see traffic in both directions i d personally be interested in trying to find some small sets of information that correlate to user experiences so that it doesn t take a terabyte of disk and 64 processors to deal with data from say 10 000 desktops anyway just some random thoughts the hard part for me at the moment is thinking about useful generalizations and infrastructure to support them cindy bickerstaff responded we re just starting to capture the mss and window size negotiations between timeit and servers to get an idea of what is typical or usual wonder if daniel s code could do that too from the various traffic monitoring points caida has out there the data could be used to fill in some parameters for trying to model some of the passive data collected since a typical web page has many elements between a single client and server the first or base page gives you a starting idea of what to expect and the subsequent elements are like repeat measurements of the same path over a very short time interval since there is a strong time of day week effect volumes and perf the short duration of the data collection from a single web page incl elements might give some options for modeling and maybe getting a better estimate of packet loss i ve really enjoyed joining the e 2 e interest group for the ideas on factors and the references to past modeling attempts e g mathis et al paper ack its bulk transfer focus paul krumviede highlighted the difficulty of agreeing on details of how to measure common metrics like availability reliability throughput and latency an example was throughput since it was proposed that this be measured using a tcp file transfer of random data one concern was what does this do to latency and where does this get measured as many customers of this service would not be large businesses measuring this from the customer end of a 56 or 64 kbps circuit was almost certain to drive end to end latency measurements beyond defined bounds measuring it from within points in the provider s network s might show figures that the customers could never see themselves the compromise was to define the throughput metric as ocurring at access link loads of no more than 50 of the bit rate but how does one measure that and so on given that this discussion was recognized as being the prelude to the imposition of minimal slas as part of the certification process for service providers this may be an illustration of the perils of discussing slas and metrics in some interchangable form but they may not be easy to separate in the minds of some carter bullard said i m specifically interested in bridging rtfm and ippm work particularly to describe how an rtfm can be a generic connectivity monitor ippm describes type p unidirection and bidirectional connectivity and a single point rtfm can detect these conditions but standard descriptions for how this can be done would be very useful personally one of the things that i m interested in is tcp based streaming services performance such as that seen in internet radio distribution and of course ip telephony wireline performance metrics would be very good to describe nevil brownlee comments that he s also very interested in developing the rtfm meter as a platform for more general measurements two areas seem interesting apart from getting more information from tcp streams qos difserv performance what metrics do we need to characterise this ipsec what metrics will still be useful when we can t look at port numbers what kinds of traffic can still be identified curtis villamizar said i m particularly interested in the work on dos at http www cs washington edu homes savage traceback html and would like to see that on the agenda this would provide a general way of determining where packets came from not just a tool for tracing dos attacks,0

subject re comments fyi forwarded by rakesh bharati na enron on 03 27 2001 07 43 pm sheridan titman on 03 27 2001 06 46 31 pm to rakesh bharati enron com cc subject re comments rakesh thanks for your input they are quite useful for helping me clarify my own thinking the following are my responses to your comments and clarifications the ed paragraphs are from me and the others are from you 1 the money is being set aside to avoid negative values it is not clear if you mean the values of the cash flow or the pv at the node anyhow we shall be setting aside money not just for that specific node but all nodes at that cross section of time as the risk free asset pays in all states of nature this will have to be done every time there is a negative realization thus for the typical project we have the value of risk capital may be extremely high as we are not following a tail based norm anymore i agree that this is confusing and needs further refinement i do this because i have some concerns about discounting negative cash flows this is discussed in my first memo this clearly provides a conservative estimate of firm value and a measure of risk capital that is too high from the perspective of evaluating the appropriate level of risk capital it is sufficient that enough capital be employed so that the pv at each node is positive also one might want to set the level so that the pv is positive in say 98 of all nodes 2 your memo appears to suggest that debt capacity is contingent on all values being positive if so we are only issuing risk free debt also a project with a single negative value at each cross section of time will not have a positive debt capacity again this is a very conservative initial estimate when the model is refined you probably want to define debt capacity so that the project defaults a certain percent of the time 3 it seems that our optimization argument is the discount rate which is obtained in each step from the comparison investment by equating the variances it is not clear if changing the discount rate will have such an effect on the project variance so as to lead to a global convergence i am not assuming that the change in the discount rate has a major effect on volatility in fact i think the process requires only one iteration when the volatility is independent of the discount rate again the idea is that we calculate the volatility of the project s value calculated with an initial discount rate using the calculated volatility and the stock of a comparison firm calculate a more appropriate discount rate if the volatility of the project s value is not affected by the change in discount rates then we are done if however the change in discount rates changes volatility then we may have to iterate let me know if this makes sense also our project has a finite life and the market based assets will have infinite lives in the light of this fact how will we define the relevant variance is it the spot variance of the returns of the comparison investment this is a good point i was thinking in terms of the average variance but this may not be correct actually we know that this is just an approximation and we need to think about whether or not it is a good approximation typically firms tend to ignore issues relating to the duration of their project cash flows when they determine discount rate which clearly does not make sense this requires some additional thought 4 finally our criterion is to subtract from the average pv the investment and also the risk capital setting risk capital to zero this model closely resembles the intuitive present value criterion and endogenously determines the discount rate this is correct my goal was to come up with something that was closely related to what you are already doing but which gives you some insight into how to define risk capital and the appropriate discount rate there are a number of ways that we can refine and improve this procedure what we need to first consider is whether or not the basic approach makes sense for the kind of projects that you are evaluating gas field case to facilitate your thinking we are providing a gas field example below we invest x million dollars to buy and develop a gas field a profile of expected production and variance of the production per year is available from the engineers at the beginning production will be autocorrelated as the profile will shift up or down based on the actual gas reserves being more or less than the estimated reserves we assume the life of the field to be 10 years with no salvage value there are fixed and variable operating costs it might be useful for you to think about applying the framework to this problem this problem is probably pretty straightforward because it is unlikely that the cash flows will be negative once the gas field is producing hence there is no need to be concerned about risk capital other than the x million dollars to buy and develop the property to value the property assuming all equity financing we calculate the value process of the developed project and compare its volatility to a comparison investment whose value process is observable e g a traded mlp the risk adjusted return of the comparison investment would then be used to discount the cash flows of the gas field please note that this procedure requires relatively strong assumptions and calculating the risk adjusted return on the comparison investment is not necessarily straightforward let me know when you would like to discuss this on another topic is it possible for you to give me information about one case where enron bought or sold a base load power plant where the purchaser financed the transaction with non recourse debt we would like the following information 1 the value of the power plant or purchase price 2 the amount of debt financing and the terms of the debt contract 3 some information about the pricing of gas power swaps and options about a year ago i gave vince a paper which develops a pricing model for project debt i don t think he thought that it could be implemented on the type of projects that enron finances however my coauthors would like to try applying the model for one case study let me know when you want to discuss these issues thanks sheridan sheridan titman department of finance college of business

market of electric energy that becomes available as a result of demand response reductions in retail and wholesale loads and 4 broadening and extending through december 31 2001 the temporary waivers of the operating and efficiency standards for qualifying facilities qfs to increase the availability of generating capacity ferc seeks comments by march 30 on a series of economic incentives aimed at ensuring timely upgrades to the western transmission grid including an increased rate of return on equity roe for projects that significantly increase transmission and can be in service by either june 1 2001 or november 1 2001 other areas that ferc requested comment on include the use of interconnection authority under the federal power act and to raise the dollar limits on the issuance of blanket certificates authorizing gas pipeline construction on hydro issues ferc requested comment on ways to increase operating flexibility at ferc licensed projects while protecting environmental resources in its effort to encourage investment in transmission infrastructure ferc asked for comments again by march 30 on a series of economic incentives aimed at ensuring upgrades to the western interconnection including the increased roe for projects that significantly increase transmission on constrained paths and can be in service by the above dates in 2001 increased roe ferc said will also be given to system upgrades over new transmission paths that can be in service by june 1 2002 or november 1 2002 ferc seeks comment on a proposed 10 year depreciation period for projects that increase transmission capacity in the short term and a 15 year depreciation period for upgrades involving new rights of way that can be of service by november 1 2002 in his dissent to the order commissioner massey argued the order focuses on quick fixes and that the measures will not close the gap between supply in demand in california the order also fails to address price relief noted massey massey also called for a full federal power act fpa section 206 investigation of california issues which would allow for the possibility of refunds on transmission incentive provisions massey lamented that the proposed roe increase to 14 percent appeared arbitrary and inconsistent with ferc policy under order no 2000 the financial provisions he said appeared to be just throwing money at the problem while generally disappointed with the order massey did express limited support for many parts of the order many of the suggestions in the order are the same actions as authorized last may said massey they were good ideas then and they are good ideas now he concluded for his part in comments at the open meeting when the order was adopted chairman hebert said the order was designed to squeeze every additional mw of supply available and to encourage the conservation of mw and stressed that ferc is doing all it can in its power to alleviate western problems he said the order seeks to eradicate the projected supply shortfall in california but noted that generation transmission siting and conservation are generally state issues ferc s removing obstacles order is posted on its web site at citation ferc issued is order removing obstacles to increased electric generation and natural gas supply in the western united states and asking for comments was issued on march 14 2001 docket no elol 47 000 a detailed analysis and summary of the specific actions taken and proposals made follows electric transmission infrastructure within 30 days the california iso and transmission owners in wscc are to prepare and file for information purposes a list of grid enhancement projects that may be underway or may not require initial siting and acquisition of rights of way ferc proposes a scaled transmission infrastructure incentive under which transmission owners of projects that increase transmission capacity at present constraints and can be in service by july 1 2001 would receive a cost based rate reflecting a 300 basis point premium return on equity and a 10 year depreciable life projects in service by november 1 2001 would get a 200 basis point premium and 10 year depreciable life ferc would use a uniform baseline return on equity for all jurisdictional transmission providers in wscc of 11 5 based on the roe ferc approved for southern california edison system upgrades that involve new rights of way add significant transfer capability and can be in service by november 1 2002 would get a cost based rate reflecting 12 5 roe or al 00 basis point premium and 15 year depreciable life facilities needed to interconnect new supply to the grid which go into service as required to accommodate the in service date of the new plant would get a cost based rate that reflected a 13 5 roe or a 200 basis point premium if in service by november 1 2001 and 12 5 roe if in service by november 1 2002 for increases in transmission capacity on constrained interfaces that do not involve significant capital investments for example installing new technology ferc proposes to allow transmission owners to increase the revenue requirement of their network service rates to ensure that each additional mw of capacity will generate revenues equal to their current firm point to point rate ferc requests comment on whether to assign the cost of any interconnection or system upgrade to a particular load or supply or alternatively to roll these costs into the average system rate extension of waivers for qfs ferc proposes to extend its temporary waivers of operating and efficiency standards for qfs applicable throughout wscc to allow increased generation through december 31 2001 the waivers were to expire on april 30 2001 the proposed waiver would allow qualifying cogenerators to sell their output above the level at which they have historically supplied this output to purchasing utility the waiver for qualifying small power production facilities in wscc with respect to their fuel use requirements under ferc regulation section 292 204 b would be extended to december 31 2001 additional capacity from on site generation ferc will adopt streamlined regulatory procedure to accommodate wholesale sales from such facilities that serve load within wscc through december 31 2001 owners of generating facilities located at business locations in wscc and used primarily for back up or self generation who would become subject to fpa by virtue of sales of such power will be permitted to sell power at wholesale without prior notice under fpa section 205 ferc also authorizes such power to be sold at market based rates ferc waives its prior notice requirement for mutually agreed upon interconnection agreements for interconnections necessary to accomplish these sales quarterly reporting is required allows demand response bidding ferc will allow retail customers as permitted by state law and wholesale customers to reduce consumption for the purpose of reselling their load reduction at wholesale ferc is granting blanket authorization consistent with its prior discussion on sales from on site generation and requires similar reporting ferc s december 15 order on the california market directed as a longer term measure that the iso pursue establishing an integrated day ahead market in which all demand and supply bids are addressed in one venue ferc seeks comments on the desirability of accelerating action on this ferc says it realizes that states play an important role in regulating retail electric service and that allowing retail load to reduce consumption for resale in wholesale markets raises legal commercial technical and regulatory issues safeguards may be needed to protect and enhance retail demand response bidding programs intention is not to undermine state programs but to promote the necessary complementary wholesale programs requests comments on how helpful this action is and how it can be accomplished consistent with state jurisdiction over retail sales contract modifications for demand response bidding there may be opportunities for public utilities to make other types of demand response arrangements with their wholesale customers as for mutually agreeable qf interconnections ferc will waive prior notice requirement for any mutually agreeable demand response related rate schedule amendments that may be required to effectuate these arrangements clarifies that demand response program costs should be treated consistently with all other types of incremental and out of pocket costs interconnections fpa section 210 d allows ferc to issue an order requiring interconnection if it makes a finding that such an order 1 is in the public interest 2 would encourage overall conservation of energy or capital optimize the efficiency of use of facilities and resources or improve the reliability of any electric utility system or federal power marketing agency to which the order applies and 3 meets the requirements of fpa section 212 ferc requests comments on whether it can use this authority under fpa section 210 d to alleviate existing impediments to electricity reaching load if the exercise of this authority may be warranted ferc seeks comments on whether it could make some of the required findings generically for the wscc region in order to respond quickly should circumstances arise requiring immediate action longer term regional solutions ferc believes an rto for the entire western region or the seamless integration of western rtos is the best vehicle for designing and implementing a long term regional solution natural gas pipeline capacity ferc has realigned its resources to respond to new applications for gas pipeline capacity and is soliciting comments on ways to expedite the approval of pipeline infrastructure needed to serve california and the west requests comments on how it might further exercise its authority over new pipeline construction to alleviate the present crisis including increasing the dollar limit thresholds for blanket certificates to 10 million and for prior notice authorizations to 30 million in order to increase the facilities qualifying for automatic authorization offering blanket certificates for construction or acquisition of portable compressor stations to enhance pipeline capacity to california and offering rate incentives to expedite construction of projects that will make additional capacity available this summer on constrained pipeline systems hydroelectric power ferc staff will hold a conference to discuss methods to address environmental protection at hydro projects while allowing increased generation requests comments on ways to allow for greater operating flexibility at commission licensed hydro projects while protecting environmental resources comments should consider 1 methods for agency involvement 2 ways to handle and expedite endangered species act consultations 3 criteria for modifying licenses and 4 identification of processes that could be implemented to provide efficiency upgrades oil pipelines ferc will explore with oil pipelines innovative proposals that could lead to ensuring an adequate flow of petroleum product into the california market conference with state commissioners ferc will hold a one day conference with state commissioners and other state

subject re storage model simple issues brad here are my thoughts on your concerns you needs curve inputs this is an it job i can help you for the curves before the system is properly set up intrinsic value vs time value the intrinsic value depends on how you allocate the volumes if you have a rough idea about the allocation as you did in the spreadsheet we can calucate the intrinsic value within the model the difference between the total and the intrinsic will be the option time value however by pre allocating volumes you killed some options in the storage model volumes are allocated dynamically therefore it is hard to distinguish the intrinsic vs time value factor of loading factor of loadings are used to give historical correlation matrix the three factors correspond to paralle shift slopping and curveture the covariance matrix in the model is expressed in the form covar row vol i correl i j colum vol j where vols are the implied volatilities from the vol curve correl i j l l residue small where l is the factor of loading matrix so in a simple words the factor of loadings say 60 x 3 are a simplier way for us to remember the historical correlation matrix say 60 x 60 let me know if i can offer further help zimin brad horn 02 15 2000 07 15 am to zimin lu hou ect ect cc sandra henderson hou ect ect subject storage model simple issues zimin thanks for your time with the revised storage valuation your right to point out the similarity to market bids here are some basic questions tied to implementation and calibration model infrastructure it support i obviously need to re build my link to the forward curves as the model is not working in my new location short term aprox 1 month i d like to establish a link to the ena database egsprod 32 in order to fetch the long dated price and volatility curves my link to ena forward curves would then be quickly severed in favor of the curves generated by the new bridgeline entity database name and data structure yet to be defined however its not clear to me what is required in this two stage process to support your model any definition of model input or minimum support requirements you provide is appreciated i ll then work with sandra henderson an enron employee providing our it support to ensure the model continues to work regardless any downstream system changes that may take place as we build and establish our separate trading systems or databases meanwhile is there anything you think you can do to ensure im up and running quickly sandra linking excel spreadsheets to bridgeline forward curves will be key to all our pricing projects not just the storage model supplied by research intrinsic vs extrinsic value it would be helpful to decompose the model s calculated storage price and to distinguish intrinsic vs extrinsic time or option value i could easily link a new spreadsheet tab to your model inputs and to calculate the intrinsic value and then through a simple difference i could determine the extrinsic value ive included a simple spreadsheet calculation for the intrinsic value for review i wanted to share this with you to ask the following does the nature of the model define intrinsic and extrinsic value differently than the simple difference proposed do you think it would make sense to do the simple value decomposition in the backcode c code via dll in order to ensure run time is faster my goal here is straightforward a to better understand the model and its sensitivities and b to determine if and when the option approach is associating significant value above and beyond the simple present value of the time spreads factor loadings what are some of the thoughts or insights you can offer with regards to factor loadings and how i should interpret the graph of the 3 factors calculated factor loadings have always been a mystery to me for example what problems should i be looking for as a warning against mispricing what if anything is implied about 1 day price change or expected curve re shapings after all curve reshapings are key to storage valuation calibration we are preparing a simple summary of descriptive statistics which should allow me to refine some of the model inputs i ll share the data when we are and model results once im up and running,0

subject steve leppard hi vince hr is working on a mid year salary review for london people that have a noticeable gap between their compensation at enron and what we would have to pay in the market for a replacement they highlighted steve as someone with a potential gap particularly in light of what we re seeing in our quant recruiting effort for credit trading and research i d like your opinion on the best way to make sure we keep steve happy and keep him at enron there are several things i see we can do 1 give him a mid year pay increase to move him closer to market i m not sure this is the best way to go especially if we only offer him a token salary increase 2 offer him more responsibility what are your thoughts on timing for making steve the official head of the london research team with my move to ebs should we accelerate this i think this is good way to keep him happy and motivated and then follow up with a more meaningful salary review at year end as part of the regular process that takes into account his greater responsibility 3 we have some people that we re trying to get under long term 3 yr contract with a 12 month notice clause obviously anyone signing one of these will want significant up front compensation for being handcuffed we ve not had a lot of success with these here in london and i would prefer to keep steve happy so he wants to stay with enron rather than contractually binding him to the job i d value your thoughts on this thanks dale,0

subject vince liberty gas storage project we appreciated the insight from zimin lu on the liberty gas storage project i had originally thought that enron could negotiate a deal directly with hng storage co on the joint development of these facilities however hngs has now retained wasserstein pirella to market the opportunity fyi wasserstein was the investment banker that handled the recent sale of the market hub partners storage facilities so they certainly would have a current list of interested parties unfortuneately we will now have to participate in another auction if we are to pursue this further i ll let you know what we decide to do alaska northern canada pipeline i would like to discuss ways that enron might enhance our prospect of participating in the initiative to bring substantial new gas reserves from alaska and northern canada to the lower 48 a large equity investment in a very expensive regulated pipeline is not likely to get much support within enron instead our competitive advantage may best be realized through the efficient and creative utilization of the existing us pipeline grid backhaul on northern natural expansion opportunities on northern border and nng or even capacity exchanges with other pipeline operators i think it would be very useful if we had the capability to model the impact of the evolving north american marketplace on that initiative and vice versa any insight we could develop on who will be the eventual winners and losers if when that large volume of new gas enters the market would be valuable i will look forward to our discussion tomorrow thursday at 1 30 pm regards jng,0

subject news article on enron india enron aftermath business line 02 21 2000 abhay mehta copyright c 2000 kasturi source world reporter tm asia intelligence wire power play a study of the enron project publishers orient longman new delhi price rs 195 the enron power project at dabhol in ratnagiri district of maharashtra has been mired in nationwide controversy ever since the inception of the project proposal in 1992 and the sordid tale ends only in 1997 with the supreme court of india refusing to even admit an appeal against the bombay high court decision of december 1996 which while commenting that this case has highlighted to the people as to how even after 50 years of independence political considerations outweigh the public interest and the interest of the state and to what extent the government can go to justify its actions not only before the public but even before the courts of law yet dismissed a public interest petition against the project on the purely technical ground of res judicata even though new facts new arguments new evidence of the violation of the laws of the land had been advanced by the petitioners the fact that the fresh violations of the law were not even considered and recorded despite the petitioners adducing the required evidence can only be termed as strange perhaps bizarre abhay mehta s simple factual documentation in fact a chronological narration of all events including the process of bending all rules of subverting the law for promoting a project involving unparalleled future liabilities for maharashtra indeed for the whole of india is not only masterly it is devastating it is a short pithy book which deserves to be read from cover to cover by all thinking citizens of this country barring the concluding chapter the epilogue there are no personal comments only facts disseminated from the original papers mostly secret documents all documentation has been carefully faithfully recorded including extracts from supposedly top secret minutes of cabinet committee meetings and the specific violations of the law which were opposed by a few public spirited civil servants much to their disadvantage have been pointed up apart from an introductory primer on electricity introduced for the benefit of the layman explaining some technical issues relating to electricity generation transmission and distribution and the background of the events of 1991 the foreign exchange crisis and the aftermath of the crisis the other fifteen chapters three appendices and fourteen annexes of the small book of 226 pages packs in an enormous volume of factual information the strange saga of the enron project and the sheer magnitude of the future problems this one single project poses for the country need to be briefly recounted here for essentially it is the coming generation which would have to face the problem the mseb has contracted to buy and if not used to pay for 2000 mw of electricity for a period of 20 years from the dabhol power company the legal entity set up by enron as an unlimited liability company registered in india through a maze of intricate crossholdings of equity by half a dozen or more front companies registered in various tax free havens abhay mehta has indicated the total payments to enron over 20 years amount to 35 billion at 1998 exchange rates around rs 1 25 000 crores over the life of the project one must record that a crude oil oil product prices have as of writing more than doubled since the above calculations were made a per the doctored figures presented by the company and its advocate the charge per unit of electricity supplied at the 1998 level of prices was to 4 39 cent per unit as capacity charge and 3 43 cents per unit for energy costs the former is indexed to the us inflation rate and the latter to international fuel prices the former may be assumed to have gone up only marginally rounded to 4 4 cents per unit we know that fuel prices have more than doubled internationally over 1999 assuming the fuel costs to have increased less than 100 per cent even though international prices have more than doubled we may assume for 1999 energy costs of 6 85 cents per units making for a total payment of 11 25 us cents per unit of electricity supplied by the dabhol power company dpc to mseb in late 1999 in phase i of the project within another two years at 2000 mw the annual offtake for 365 days x 24 hours day would be 17 52 billion kwh and at 11 25 cents per unit the total payment amounts to 1 97 billion annually for 20 years this workout to 39 4 billion this is not counting any further inflation in either energy costs or capacity charge at today s exchange rate about rs 43 5 per us dollar in rupee terms this works out to wore than rs 175 000 crores as compared to rs 125 000 crores indicated by abhay mehta this is the cost to mseb in rupee and to the country in foreign exchange as payment to just one project authority for supply of part of the power required in maharashtra the really significant point to note in this connection is that this payment and considerably more depending on a future increase in capacity charges depending on us inflation rate and international prices of lngaphtha for fuel costs and b depreciation of the exchange rate of the rupee vis a vis the us dollar is obligatory the assets of the mseb the maharashtra government indeed all assets of the government of india present and future are mortgaged to enron by way of sovereign guarantees extended by both governments the other significant point in this connection is that as predicted by all independent indian experts as well as the world bank the enron project he forced the mseb to cut its offtake of tata electric company s and its own much cheaper thermal power already in a postscript dated august 1999 abhay mehta has indicated that already the mseb had stopped buying between 200 and 250 mw of power from tata electric available at rs 1 80 per unit and has had to backdown its own chandrapur thermal power station cost of this power being rs 1 20 per unit while forced to buy more expensive enron power at rs 5 per unit the loss to mseb on this count alone comes to rs 460 crore per year this had in fact been predicted earlier even by the world bank it is pointless here to go into the details of how precisely all this was contrived by a deliberate campaign of disinformation of blatant lies of sidelining of expert opinion not only of independent experts but also the goi s own official advisers in this matter namely the central electricity authority as well as that of the world bank which was resolutely opposed to this project the detailed facts the letters exchanged in the above context the pressure tactics adopted the flouting of all procedures norms even statutory provisions of the electricity supply act are all carefully documented by abhay mehta mehta correctly concludes we frequently blame external agencies like the world bank for all our problems when as a matter of fact we ourselves are our own worst enemies in the instant case the world bank not only advised the government of india against the project it stood resolutely firm in its assessment of the total inadvisability of this project in fact one must note here that in 1996 neighbouring pakistan which had entered into a somewhat similar mou with enron cancelled the project and the power purchase agreement with enron for a 670 million 782 mw residual oil fuelled power plant even though that agreement had stipulated enron power supply at a fixed rate of 6 4 us cents per kwh over a 30 year period note the estimated rate of 11 25 cents per kwh for dabhol power for the mseb in december 1999 which works out to around rs 5 per unit one could go on but one must leave the reader to go through abhay mehta s crisp factual matter of fact narration of the enron saga and switch over to the point made by him in the epilogue to the story about the next round of scams for quite some time the ruling elite in india has been intent on privatising all public enterprises and even utilities are no exception the unbundling of infrastructure with a view to privatisation of all the profitable segments all this as per the current disinformation campaign is supposedly in the interest of rationalisation and greater efficiency of poorer supply the author has referred in this context to the acquisition from the government by the torrent group of the ahmedabad and surat electricity companies at less than one tenth of the market value of the assets of thee facilities again much like the enron saga all objections by the finance department of the gujarat government were overruled and abhay mehta has predicated that this onslaught the break up of power utilities into three segments generation transmission and distribution with a view to their privatisation is likely to be the new thrust by the ruling elite for reasons that do not require to be spelt out though mehta had the examples of the torrent group takeover of ahmedabad and surat electricity companies and of the break up of the orissa state electricity board before him yet his statement can be stated today to be prophetic the upseb is now on the firing line the recent strike by the workers and engineers of the upseb in protest of the announced up government decision to trifurcate the upseb and the union minister of power mr rangarajan kumaramangalam s statement that the upseb is a loss making inefficient unit and that privatisation of the facilities after the trifurcation need to be noted that 40 per cent of the dues of the upseb are from the up government that tariffs for up electricity supply are fixed by the up government and not by the upseb that the upseb does not have the cash even for routine maintenance as a result of the above these are facts that nobody is prepared even to consider that the remedy for upseb lies in a different kind of reform and restructuring is not even to be debated the whole idea is to privatise the profitable segments and to leave the public sector entity with all the problem areas including rural energy supply it is against this background that abhay mehta s book needs to be widely disseminated read and its implications understood what is at stake is not a utility here or a psu there what is at stake is the future of some 80 per cent of the have nots in this country what is at stake is the pillory of the assets of the nation for private aggrandisement arun ghosh,0
subject re uk power gas vince just fyi oliver risk control in london was asking if it is appropriate to use a set of factors corresponding to some commodity for another commodity this mapping we do quite frequently in our var system when forward prices for a commodity are not correlated because of poor price history i think using this kind of mappings is ok because we can not trust these correlations based on illiquid price information if we believed the matrix with low correlations represents what goes on in the market and we simply can not reconstruct it with our 7 factors then we might use more factors then 7 or the matrix itself tanya tanya tamarchenko 12 15 2000 02 36 pm to oliver gaylard lon ect ect cc david port market risk corp enron enron rudi zipter hou ect ect wenyao jia hou ect ect kirstee hewitt lon ect ect debbie r brackett hou ect ect naveen andrews corp enron enron subject re uk power gas oliver i completely agree with you validating var inputs like positions prices and volatilities which are used by risktrac is the first thing to do you also rise a valid question if the factor loadings for some commodity do not make sense should we use the factor loadings for another commodity the factor loadings do not make sense when the correlations across the term structure are not high so if we believe that the forward prices for this commodity are market prices and statistical analysis on these prices produces the correlations which we trust then it would be proper to use this correlation matrix in var engine not the factors using factors is simply the way to speed up calculations for highly correlated prices without sacrificing the accuracy tanya oliver gaylard 12 15 2000 07 11 am to naveen andrews corp enron enron cc david port market risk corp enron enron rudi zipter hou ect ect wenyao jia hou ect ect kirstee hewitt lon ect ect tanya tamarchenko hou ect ect ganapathy ramesh hou ect ect debbie r brackett hou ect ect subject re uk power gas naveen regarding the calculation of uk vars in risk trac i agree that we should be using this calculation engine for all commodity vars however we should not focus solely on the uk but ensure that we use risk trac for continental power and gas uk power and gas nordic power to use risk trac i think the following need to be resolved first to implement it right the first time as i think it is incorrect to consider the risk trac numbers as the most accurate since it depends on the validity of these items positions delta and gamma and curve mapping these need to include all positions including those outside the main risk systems positions curves and mapping should now be no problem given the feeds apart from continental power have been uat d and we have the spreadsheet feeds up and running price and vol curves as used by the risk systems as above inter commodity correlation prompt month correlation should be easy to calculate given an accurate and complete data set however the incomplete historic data for europe in risk trac prior to the formation of the task force would mean a full data set needs to be obtained and used term structure of correlation would be good but i understand this is difficult to use in the calculation factor loadings i think factor loadings should be calculated on the same data sets used for inter commodity correlation for all commodities if this analysis does not appear to work i am not sure that using factor loadings for other markets is adequate do we need to consider an alternative approach to calculating var for these markets to ensure this moves forward i think a list of the mile stones responsibilities and time lines needs to be drawn up otherwise i fear the process of moving across to risk trac from the spreadsheet var will experience some slippage i will call today to start the process off rgds oliver naveen andrews enron 06 12 2000 21 50 to oliver gaylard lon ect ect cc david port market risk corp enron enron rudi zipter hou ect ect wenyao jia hou ect ect kirstee hewitt lon ect ect tanya tamarchenko hou ect ect ganapathy ramesh hou ect ect debbie r brackett hou ect ect subject uk power gas oliver i had a couple of issues pertaining to uk power uk gas first just a few notes as it pertains to risk trac uk implementation 1 in risktrac currently all the gas curves are mapped to nbp 2 all the power curves are mapped to r 4 cinergy factor loading analysis lends itself only to nbp and the norewgian curves for reasons of liquidity etc we have decided that nbp and cinergy are the best curves available at this time the spreadsheet which is utilized in the uk also has curves mapped to a 2 3 year old set of factors derived from us nat gas which is clearly not optimal hence 1 we should be using risktrac numbers for var as it is the most accurate both in terms of ene wide model usage and in terms of the most recent updated data ever since uk power came on board in risktrac 3 weeks ago the uk power number has been consistently 7 8 mm above the numbers in your spreadsheet this difference is to be ecpected given the different inputs 2 the consistent numbers do not point to a data error in any obvious way however if you believe that positions are not captured correctly please let our it staff know that 3 checks which ramesh has done indicate that positions are tying in however as you know there could be disconnects with enpower etc in any event it would be ideal and optimal to have all the simulations run out of risktrac for reasons of aggregation and analysis your help is appreciated regards

subject california 1 17 01 summary late night efforts by the california assembly to craft a legislative solution are falling short of market and creditor expectations bankruptcy appears increasingly likely but the dynamics of a ch 11 proceeding remain unclear socal edison is likely to be the first in ch 11 following its suspended payments to creditors yesterday and is now in a 30 day cure period attempts to bring in the assets of the parent companies are unlikely to succeed bankruptcy would provide davis with some political cover to implement the tough decisions that he has so far avoided on the questions of rate hikes and other costs to taxpayers connected to the proposed operations of the california power authority 1 legislation passes assembly but generators and consumers remain unhappy the first legislation ab lx passed the california general assembly last night but both generators and consumers are unhappy with the terms generators object to the 5 5 cent per kw h price in the proposed long term contract while consumer groups such as the foundation for taxpayer and consumer rights object to the state acting as a purchaser of power the legislation is expected to pass the senate today and to be signed by governor davis as early as tonight press and source reporting this morning confirms that the principal financial creditors and utility analysts are also unimpressed with the bill which is viewed as insubstantial and falling short of creating a solution to the financial pressures on the utilities 2 financial institutions exposure to california utilities bank of america 215 million j p morgan 202 million there is a total of 12 billion in outstanding loans but much of this arranged by societe general is to the parents national energy group and edison international the 417 million mentioned above is the most immediate concern the southern california edison loans are subject to immediate repayment in the aftermath of yesterday s rating downgrade to junk status the fed will not be involved except in a routine way as a bank regulator making sure that the appropriate risk reserves are made against the utilities loans and securities there is no moral hazard here because the fed is not going to guarantee any of the utilities credits which by the way they do not have the authority to do 3 pg e national energy group shielding assets despite considerable anger at pg e for reorganizing to shield its profitable assets from its debt plagued utility business it would seem that davis has little authority to intervene the question of fraudulent conveyance which is a term in bankruptcy law for transferring assets to favored parties not long before a filing which transfer can then be reversed by the court would not seem to apply here since pg dynegy has threaten to take take edison into bankruptcy court if they default pg e current available 500 m in cash and reserves due feb lst 580 m to iso 15 th 431 m to california power exchange contrary to press reports and leaks from the governor s office yesterday about political brinksmanship edison is clearly not playing negotiating games and is really short of cash in this situation it is unlikely that its executives will be making fraudulent statements the bonds on which they failed to pay would have a 30 day cure period after that the trustees will move on edison if edison has not already filed they have three ways of financing power purchases going forward 1 the state continues to buy power and sell edison and pg or 2 pending the passage of today s legislation the state legislature authorizes the purchase of power through long term contracts under the proposed borrowing authority or 3 edison files for reorganization under chapter 11 and obtains almost immediately superpriority post petition lines of credit secured against its unmortgaged assets which it uses to pay for power until the puc and the rest of the state government recognize that rates have to increase 6 new hampshire experience a guide for davis following the bankruptcy of the public service company of new hampshire the bankruptcy judge was authorized by a higher court to mandate rate hikes the prospect of imposed rate hikes from the bankruptcy court caused the state government to subsequently determine that rate hikes to consumers were unavoidable passing a seven year rate hike of 7 5 percent for davis a similar scenario would provide him with some political cover if he were forced by the bankruptcy court to pass through rate hikes as part of a settlement,0

subject stephen bennett vince for your use as per our discussions mike forwarded by mike a roberts hou ect on 12 09 2000 10 32 am from mike a roberts 12 09 2000 10 33 am to vince j kaminski hou ect ect cc subject stephen bennett stephen bennett professional meteorologist was hired into the research group in september of this year as a specialist based on salary alignment criteria in retrospect and upon review he should have been hired on as a senior specialist after coming on board it rapidly became apparent that stephen was clearly an under hire he is well deserving of an immediate promotion really more of a correction and pay raise to be made retroactive at least to the lst of this month this memo outlines the circumstances surrounding this hiring error and provides detailed justifications for this retroactive promotion at the time of the interview process there was no position in enron designated as professional meteorologist in fact the most recent similar hire prior to that date was jose marquez also a professional meteorologist who was hired in based on salary alignment criteria as a manager while functionally both these men are meteorologists enron has no such job classification compounded by the urgency in bringing on additional professional expertise in short time order it was difficult to peg the proper enron classification appropriate for this new position this original uncertainty and resulting misplacement of stephen into the specialist category rather than the senior specialist category needs to be corrected at this time although a new hire to enron stephen bennett has extensive work experience he has worked as a professional meteorologist at both the weather services corporation in boston and at the weather channel in atlanta he came to enron well referenced by both those organizations needing no further training and only minimal supervision once aboard here in houston stephen immediately demonstrated the core enron values with our unique sense of urgency after only a week he assumed responsibilities normally reserved for someone actually at even a manager level he was assigned and fully took over the critical afternoon weather briefings to the gas traders this includes analysis and report preparation as well as presentation also in the presentation arena he now regularly briefs various desks in the morning and throughout the day stephen is a master of communication and particularly adept at conveying what through other messengers might otherwise seem confusing or ambiguous stephen has also demonstrated an unusually high level of self initiative he designed implemented and now maintains several sub sites on the research web page which he tailored to various customers in specific the weather derivatives team the agricultural team and most recently the crude and liquids team i have recently assigned stephen to spearhead our conversion and major upgrade of this web page these above described accomplishments are above and beyond stephen  s regular duties which include starting work at 5 am daily reliably and without fail to assemble and prepare our trader  s weather report recently with the advent of extended hours for both nymex and enrononline stephen voluntarily on his own accord assists in our new sunday weather support effort as his supervisor fully cognizant of his already standard 50 hour work week i do not solicit but readily accept this above and beyond expectations assistance in review the circumstance which resulted in this under hire condition was enron  s immediate need for a non standard fairly unique professional a meteorologist coupled with stephen  s desire to work for our company in spite of the absence of a hierarchy which included the exact entitled professional title reflecting his chosen career path once hired stephen has clearly demonstrated through contribution and performance that he is well deserving of this immediate and retroactive promotion,0

subject re houston research opportunity anjam s plight grant i agree we shall give him an offer of a job in houston on the terms we discussed with plus an option to stay in london if he does not like houston his choice i think we extended a very generous offer to him and he may have an excessive perception of his contribution to enron vince enron north america corp from grant masson 08 09 2000 02 41 pm to vince j kaminski hou ect ect cc subject re houston research opportunity anjam s plight vince i got the following note from uk hr after had a call from them earlier today i told them that the deal you and i communicated to anjam was firm and not negotiable with the exception of the issues regarding the flat rental apparently anjam is trying to play hard ball what s your commitment to anjam should we explore a package deal my vote is no grant tara rozen 08 09 2000 12 17 pm to grant masson hou ect ect cc melanie doyle lon ect ect subject houston research opportunity grant unfortunately we were unsuccessful in our attempt to convince anjam that he should transfer on a local us package the difficulty is not so much the compensation and benefits it seems more to do with the actual job and long term prospects he will only therefore commit to 12 months and only on assignment terms we explained to anjam the rationales for transferring locally ie not just cost but equitability among his peers he is convinced that his skills and enron knowledge are valueable enough to warrant an assignment rather than a local deal also he was apparently told by vince that it was impossible for you to find a local hire for this role as you were not paying the market rate would you like to move further with this if so we can put together costs for you for a 12 month assignment and see what you think i am out tomorrow but back in on friday and could do it for you then let us know regards tara forwarded by tara rozen lon ect on 09 08 2000 18 14 melanie doyle 08 08 2000 13 07 to tara rozen lon ect ect cc madeline fox lon ect ect subject houston research opportunity tara can we discuss tomorrrow thanks mel forwarded by melanie doyle lon ect on 08 08 2000 13 04 enron europe from anjam ahmad 08 08 2000 12 08 to vince j kaminski hou ect ect grant masson hou ect ect cc melanie doyle lon ect ect subject houston research opportunity dear vince i would like to make the suggestion that we make this opportunity a one year assignment working with tanya and then re evaluate the situation at the end of the year in terms a new role for me in houston thereafter subject to mutual agreement the alternative situation of resigning from enron europe and re joining enron corp is too dramatic and requires me to burn bridges and my return to enron europe would be difficult also i would lose the valuable support structures available to me in london the amount of any fixed costs flights modest cargo a few months of mortgage carrying cost are entirely reasonable not excessive given my single status and not so great that they justify making the contract a three year local one i would expect that on the basis of almost 3 1 2 years solid experience value added at enron europe the value of several million pounds i have identified justified to external auditors for enron europe this year and an excellent rating my fourth making my 3 1 2 yr average rating also excellent i could reasonably be expected to justify a fair deal i e my existing enron europe salary benefits package plus a reasonable one off allowance to cover unavoidable additional personal expenses regards thanks again for the opportunity anjam x 35383,0

subject re equity investment fair value in turkey john it seems to me that using a risk free rate is not appropriate i shall elaborate on my position and send you a longer message this afternoon my time vince enron capital trade resources corp europe from john bottomley 06 19 2000 05 55 am to vince j kaminski hou ect ect cc john sherriff lon ect ect dale surbey lon ect ect subject equity investment fair value in turkey vince john sherriff recommended that i contact you regarding an interesting and potentially contentious option valuation issue we are currently dealing with in london we hold longish term options in a private company in turkey which is currently seeking to ipo the issue we are discussing with rac is which discount rate i e risk free and if so turkish or us should we use to value these options first some additional information option characteristics 116 000 options representing 9 of the company term minimum of 3 years but possibly longer still being renegotiated strike price 20 below the upcoming ipo price either priced in us or turkish lire we currently hold the above number of options with a fixed price of 118 75 per option but 34 800 expire on july 15 2000 with the remainder expiring on december 15 2000 the company s investment bankers abn amro rothchilds are concerned regarding the strike price because it values the company at 118 million and they believe the company is worth approx 300 million due to such a large valuation gap they originally encouraged us to exercise all of the options by the end of june ipo target date in late sept early oct our counter proposal is to swap instrinsic value for time value by repricing the options strike higher while extending their term we are currently negotiating with rac the most appropriate discount rate to use to value the options we are arguing that the us risk free is the most appropriate discount rate and their current position is that the company s historical senior debt cost 18 is the more appropriate number to use although admit that this is not justifiable only a proxy a few key points rac is valuing the options via crystal ball simulations such that this to be negotiated discount rate is used to calculate the pv of the future options intrinsic value in 3 years i e for black scholes a higher discount rate yields a higher value but the opposite is true using crystal ball simulation the model simulates both an ipo no ipo case and in the case of no ipo we have put options for our equity priced at a fixed 17 return the model assigns a 30 illiquidity discount in the simulated cases where the options are out of the money we obviously do not exercise we understand that for black scholes option valuation one needs to be able to construct a comparable portfolio of cash flows using equity futures and the risk free in order for the valuation to hold and here is where we reach our difficulty since the company doesn t currently trade on a public market and since equity futures do not exist for turkish equities rac is arguing that a us risk free is not appropriate to use our argument is that the non ipo scenario a 30 illiquidity discount and a us based option volatility are already in the factored into the simulation as such we feel rac s approach is double counting if you managed to get through the above your a patient man i ll give you a call today or tomorrow after you ve had a chance to digest the information regards john bottomley,0

interconnection l l c together with alstom esca corporation a systems developer for electric utilities today announce their intent to formalize an agreement that will not only standardize their electricity markets but will lead they believe to the standardization of wholesale electricity markets across the country today iso new england delivered a letter to the chairman and commissioners of the federal energy regulatory commission ferc enclosing a report concerning its proposed comprehensive wholesale market program that combines salient features of the pjm market model with elements of its own existing wholesale market design the combination would create a standardized wholesale market structure called the standard market design for wholesale electricity markets standard market design iso new england alstom esca and pjm acting through its wholly owned subsidiary pjm technologies inc have agreed to proceed with the negotiation of an agreement where iso new england will purchase the existing pjm market design and certain software components from alstom esca and pjm the two isos and alstom esca will work together to create a standardized market design that includes solutions to reserve markets and a common solution to unit dispatch this new market standard should put into place the necessary market improvements more quickly and at a reduced cost than if we were to implement a customized market system for new england said william w berry chairman and acting ceo of iso new england now is the time to stop the experimentation ultimately we hope the standard market design will serve as the benchmark for wholesale electricity marketplaces across the country if not around the world pjm is very excited to further standardize a design for a competitive wholesale electricity market said phillip g harris chairman and ceo of pjm along with the progress in the implementation of the pjm west concept this initiative will provide an even broader standardized market design this approach should further expedite the elimination of trading barriers across different markets and promote ferc s goal of creating a seamless marketplace we intend to continue to work with the new york iso on issues of mutual importance stated mr berry this new market design together with our efforts to address the market seams and other coordination issues will eventually bring the three northeast iso markets closer together iso new england and the new york iso will continue to work together on these issues under a joint board resolution passed on january 16

across northeast trading markets to develop a more seamless marketplace where everyone will benefit said william j museler president and ceo of the new york independent system operator the new york

developed jointly with stakeholder input iso new england will propose the standard market design to the new england conference of public utility commissioners and the new england power pool in a series of meetings next week additional meetings will be conducted in the next few weeks the standard market design for new england will be subject to ferc approval standardization requires consistent and reliable technology to facilitate a market s efficiency a market that moderates price fluctuations and encourages investment based on an expected return is an efficient market and efficiency is the key to establishing market liquidity said alain steven ceo of alstom esca in the future this agreement will be viewed as a catalyst in establishing more robust electricity markets iso new england

margaret carson corp enron enron cc subject poten s fuel oil report niamh doug margaret i want to chat about this and will call you but the essence is can you justify sharing the cost of subscribing to poten s monthly fuel oil report attached below are 3 example copies that include their standard 12 month price forecasts the cost is 3800 yr as an added service for a total of 10 000 yr poten will include a quarterly update of their 36 month forward view on crude oil and fo prices with a brief justification for their view this would include the standard monthly price forecast for the prompt 12 months and quarterly prices for the following 24 months for far east med and nwe i expect a more descriptive email from poten but i think this is the essence of their custom offer the example copies attached include the following special features 99 feb analysis of resid trades in the eastern mediterranean 99 sep patterns of fuel oil trade in the western hemisphere 99 dec analysis of the resid market in chile these type of features are produced monthly and run a spectrum of subjects related to fuel oil i have a hard time justifying the cost of the newsletter and the price forecast without the considered recommendation of colleagues such as yourself regarding the utility of such a report the best way to show your recommendation is with money if it is not worth any money to anyone else in ene then i have to question its validity and utility to me as well doug would this perhaps be useful to any other business units that have exposure to fo prices best regards guy forwarded by guy

subject conference call on friday march 17 th hello nick i agree e mail is much easier there is a two hour time difference between calif and texas i e 1 00 pm texas time 11 00 am calif time would tomorrow at 11 00 am calif time be ok with you 1 00 pm texas this time is fine for vince tom gros and stinson gibner can they call you and if so what number please let me know thanks shirley 713 853 5290 nick bambos on 03 16 2000 12 28 58 pm to shirley crenshaw enron com cc bambos stanford stanford edu subject re visit to enron shirley it s easier to communcate by e mail since i am moving from meeting to meeting but i have the laptop always with me please give me a phone number that i could call tomorrow what is the time difference between california and your location i think it s 2 hours ca tx is that right i can do the conference call any time from 9 11 ca time would that be ok on your side thanks nick vince j kaminski enron com wrote nick we can close the loop on our commitment to support the research projects before your visit to enron my assistant shirley crenshaw will call you to set up a conference call with me stinson gibner and tom gros from enron broadband services to discuss all the isssues friday this week would work for both tom and me i think we need about 15 minutes vince p s shirley nick s phone number is 650 796 8163 cell 650 725 5525 office nick bambos on 03 12 2000 05 32 35 pm to vince j kaminski enron com bambos stanford stanford edu cc subject visit to enron hello vince it was nice seeing you at stanford and many thanks for the lunch we had together i really enjoyed our discussions both at the technical level and otherwise i promised to send you an e mail regarding possible dates for a visit to enron i delayed it for a week till my schedule was clearer let s see if we can get a match with your schedule mine is rather terrible friday 21 st of april looks good but april 23 rd is easter sunday so that may make it difficult for some people at enron to be around let me know if that is the case i am willing to visit then because the week after that i am scheduled to be in japan and in the previous weeks i am all committed on fridays friday 19 th of may is the next possibility but this probably is too far out the main problem is that i am operating within a window of opportunity for attracting top students for this research this window closes by the end of april and it would be important for the student support funds to be in place then so that i can make hard commitments to students and attract top talent i am already reviewing files of students who have approached me for phd advising and i am in a mode of doing soft commitments to star level students to get this research and its potential on their radar screen top students are highly sought after by advisors and i want to be an early player in this competition does my visit to enron have to happen before we can set up the project and student support at stanford if so doing it before the end of april is important for getting top people if the visit can happen after we get the ball rolling then we can schedule it in may i assume there will be multiple visits both ways when the project gets going please let me know what you think best regards nick,0

subject california update 5 4 01 if you have any questions please contact kristin walsh at 713 853 9510 bridge loan financing bills may not meet their may 8 th deadline due to lack of support sources report there will not be a vote regarding the authorization for the bond issuance bridge loan by the may 8 th deadline any possibility for a deal has reportedly fallen apart according to sources both the republicans and democratic caucuses are turning against davis the democratic caucus is reportedly unwilling to fight for davis many legislative republicans and democrats reportedly do not trust davis and express concern that once the bonds are issued to replenish the general fund davis would double dip into the fund clearly there is a lack of good faith between the legislature and the governor however it is believed once davis discloses the details of the power contracts negotiated a bond issuance will take place additionally some generator sources have reported that some of the long term power contracts as opposed to those still in development require that the bond issuance happen by july 1 2001 if not the state may be in breach of contract sources state that if the legislature does not pass the bridge loan legislation by may 8 th having a bond issuance by july lst will be very difficult the republicans were planning to offer an alternative plan whereby the state would eat the 5 billion cost of power spent to date out of the general fund thereby decreasing the amount of the bond issuance to approximately 8 billion however the reportedly now are not going to offer even this concession sources report that the republicans intend to hold out for full disclosure of the governor s plan for handling the crisis including the details and terms of all long term contracts he has negotiated before they will support the bond issuance to go forward currently there are two bills dealing with the bridge loan ab 8 x and ab 31 x ab 8 x authorizes the dwr to sell up to 10 billion in bonds this bill passed the senate in march but has stalled in the assembly due to a lack of republican support ab 31 x deals with energy conservation programs for community college districts however sources report this bill may be amended to include language relevant to the bond sale by senator bowen currently in ab 8 x senator bowen s language states that the state should get paid before the utilities from rate payments which if passed would be likely to cause a socal bankruptcy according to sources close to the republicans in the legislature republicans do not believe there should be a bridge loan due to money available in the general fund for instance tony strickland has stated that only 1 2 of the bonds or approximately 5 billion should be issued other republicans reportedly do not support issuing any bonds the republicans intend to bring this up in debate on monday additionally lehman brothers reportedly also feels that a bridge loan is unnecessary and there are some indications that lehman may back out of the bridge loan key points of the bridge financing initial loan amount 4 125 b lenders jp morgan 2 5 b lehman brothers 1 0 b bear stearns 625 m tax exempt portion of the 4 125 b 1 6 b is expected to be tax exempt projected interest rate taxable rate 5 77 tax exempt rate 4 77 current projected blended ir 5 38 maturity date august 29 2001 for more details please contact me at 713 853 9510 bill sb 6 x passed the senate yesterday but little can be done at this time the senate passed sb 6 x yesterday which authorizes 5 billion to create the california consumer power and conservation authority the 5 billion authorized under sb 6 x is not the same as the 5 billion that must be authorized by the legislature to pay for power already purchased or the additional amount of bonds that must be authorized to pay for purchasing power going forward again the republicans are not in support of these authorizations without the details of the long term power contracts the governor has negotiated the republicans do not know what the final bond amount is that must be issued and that taxpayers will have to pay to support no further action can be taken regarding the implementation of sb 6 x until it is clarified how and when the state and the utilities get paid for purchasing power also there is no staff defined purpose etc for the california public power and conservation authority however this can be considered a victory for consumer advocates who began promoting this idea earlier in the crisis socal edison and bankruptcy at this point two events would be likely to trigger a socal bankruptcy the first would be a legislative rejection of the mou between socal and the governor the specified deadline for legislative approval of the mou is august 15 th however some decision will likely be made earlier according to sources the state has yet to sign the mou with socal though socal has signed it the republicans are against the mou in its current form and davis and the senate lack the votes needed to pass if the legislature indicates that it will not pas the mou socal would likely file for voluntary bankruptcy or its creditor involuntary due to the lack operating cash the second likely triggering event which is linked directly to the bond issuance would be an effort by senator bowen to amend sb 31 x bridge loan stating that the dwr would received 100 of its payments from ratepayers then the utilities would receive the residual amount in other words the state will get paid before the utilities if this language is included and passed by the legislature it appears likely that socal will likely file for bankruptcy socal is urging the legislature to pay both the utilities and the dwr proportionately from rate payments,0

he was responsible for modeling traffic etc it appears that sycamore finally got him one time they had lost him to corvis another optical equipment company i guess sycamore went back to him with a better deal as soon as this guy is available i ll set up an all day technical meeting to hash out what needs to be done as far as optimization algorithm development is concerned i want to produce a technical requirement document to clearly outline what needs to be done to support dynamic optical switched circuits based trading and streaming media applications etc having such an industry expert help us will help justify internally all the the effort on the traffic analysis side that john griebling has asked us to support keep in mind that even though he is an expert in the field the field that we need to play in has not develop yet even the emerging data based traffic as opposed to voice where blocking of traffic is allowed analysis is an order of magnitude more difficult due to uncertain load let alone trading such load which we are planning to do ravi sycamore hired a guy per griebling s request to work with you on the design planning piece of the business he will be

subject california power update 1 17 01 pt iii 1 california ag exploring investigation of power profits sources report that the california attorney general s office in a meeting yesterday ordered a review of the federal profiteering statute in keeping with the recent rhetoric by gov davis this action is almost certainly directed toward investigations of profits made by generators and marketers 2 more detail on bankruptcy creditors concerned about lengthy cure period the generators want to limit their exposure as general creditors in a chapter 11 proceeding their ability to their exposure depends on the cure period for making good on a defaulted payment which would be dictated by the specific contract terms if the cure period that is the time the utilities have available to make up for missed payments before the generators or the power exchange can take them to court is a short period of time for the sake of argument 30 days then the utilities creditors have to swallow another 30 days of accumulated impaired receivables before they can move to the more desirable position of postpetition suppliers in which bills do get paid as would be directed by the bankruptcy court judge if however the utilities have a longer cure period for the sake of argument 60 days then their creditors will effectively have to swallow 60 days of accumulated impaired receivables on which they will ultimately have to take a substantial haircut,0

subject energy finance critiques david here are the reviews of the ut energy finance program that you requested from jennifer martinez mba class of 1999 energy finance taken fall of 1998 the energy finance program 2 years ago was very good especially considering it was the first year of the program there were a lot of guest speakers from various energy companies who gave us a lot of practical knowledge about the energy industry through case studies lectures etc basically we learned all the same finance concepts and tools as in the regular finance classes but all the cases and examples were energy related the professors were good for the most part but didn t have a great deal of practical industry experience if i had to guess the reason for decreased participation in the program i would probably say it is the professors ronn and titman are great but known as being very technical and quantitative some students prefer less technical professors and classes that aren t limiting to the energy industry also the fact that the class meets for 3 hours twice a week may not be so appealing other than those things i can t imagine why there has been such a drop in enrollment i especially don t understand why every single person didn t drop for enron i wonder if it has something to do with international status from john massey mba class of 1999 energy finance taken fall of 1998 bottom line ut business schools is great investment fund best activity available to students energy finance program fairly weak it was a watered down version of the futures options class crossed with a weak finance appendage the finance teacher was pathetic both a poor teacher ignorant about industry specific analysis devoid of industry experience rude to outside lectures from industry keith brown was the only educator that was any good and he only had a small portion of the class time way to make better get teachers with practical industry experience make it a seminar class focus on case studies lectures given by people from industry promote the class within the business school i felt like ut did a poor job of internally to students promoting the class from ross mesquita mba class of 1999 energy finance taken fall of 1998 to be honest a great majority of the coursework was not energy specific when energy applications were presented it seemed more like general finance questions were reworded to include energy lingo we had some very good speakers but for the most part i did not feel like the 6 hours of class had enough energy focus i assumed that this would get better as the program progressed one reason that may account for the decline in enrollment is that energy finance is a very specific focus i would have probably not enrolled in the energy finance program had it been available in my first year i did not know enough about energy at that time and i had returned to b school to consider several career options i e investment banking corporate finance entrepreneurship marketing etc as a new mba student i would not want to narrow my window of opportunities to only energy companies here is my perspective and probably something that is true of many mbas my interest in enron brought me to the energy industry and not vice versa from billy braddock mba class of 1999 energy finance taken fall of 1998 i was a participant in the inaugural energy finance program in the fall of 1998 the primary positives to the class revolved around outside panels instruction for example enron sent representatives on 2 separate occasions to discuss particular topics vince kaminski and gary hickerson other notable speakers were jeff sandefer independent business consultant and e p professional the beacon group and encap investments another good speaker was a professor from ut s school of engineering he brought a good perspective as to the basics of the energy business the class was structured via a team based instruction approach with 3 professors team teaching a 6 hour credit course none of the 3 professors had any product knowledge of the energy business of the 3 professors 2 were research focussed tenured with little credibility in teaching one of the professors primary focus of research was fixed income while the other 2 were investments and corporate finance respectively as is the case for ut s finance program in general and energy finance in particular ut is in dire need of teaching professors as opposed to research professors that have the ability to convey finance with practical examples and at a level that can be more easily be understood by students without a finance background particular to the energy program ut needs to have more instruction from energy professionals such as the instructors used for enron s internal learning programs ie derivatives classes etc from bryan williams mba class of 1999 energy finance taken fall of 1998 i participated in the first energy finance class offered in fall of 1998 at the university of texas the curriculum was understandably  rough around the edges  8 as 1998 was the first year the energy finance course was offered however the instruction also suffered as none of the instructors had any energy background to speak of the 6 credit hour class was team taught by three tenured professors two of the three professors have co authored textbooks and the third professor  s claim to fame is fixed income as a group the three professors are research heavy as opposed to industry focused and the team teaching format did not incent any one of the profs to be personably accountable for the success of the class that said the instructors did a good job attracting some top notch outside speakers among them vince kaminski gary hickerson both of enron they also dedicated one class period to a video conference call with the beacon group an energy consulting group that i believe was recently acquired by goldman jeff sandefer an independent businessman an entreprenuership instructor and one of the foremost experts in the e there are some experienced brand name professors e g sheridan titman teaching in the program cons the program should give the students more exposures to energy companies such as enron specifically it might need to help students link to the interview oppurtunites from these energy companies such as enron from george huan mba class of 2000 energy finance taken fall of 1999 companies expect mba students to have both general management new ideas and analytic quantative skills energy industry is no exception energy finance program offers financial strategy and risk managements courses which fit in the insudtry need however these two courses are far from enough to help students understand the dynemic of industrial transformation and excitements and opportunities in this industry other management and quantitive courses are needed to complete this program my suggestions 1 seminars or lectures about energy industry and energy companies before students make their decisions let them know what s happening and what s going to happen in this industry what the companies are doing now who they are looking for 2 management and or analytical courses should be included such as strategy financial enginering and real option 3 more industry connections presentations and discussions from charlie weldon mba class of 2000 energy finance taken in fall of 1999 my experience in the energy finance program overall was a positive experience the most rewarding part of the class was the guest speakers brought in during dr titman s portion of the class this part of the course is taught in the second half of the semester and consisted of 10 case classes all focusing on the energy industry two of the cases were based on enron and overall the case selection in my opinion was very appropriate and well thought out value added by the professor was less than from the speakers and cases the first eight weeks of the course covered futures and options nearly all of the examples and problems discussed pertained directly to the energy industry and special emphasis was placed on increasing the student s understanding of the supply and demand dynamics in the power market the use of options and futures for speculating and or hedging was stressed on numerous occasions and a decent attempt at explaining how to value a power plant project i believe that the university energy finance faculty are trying to continuously make improvements to the program however i do not believe that they are moving fast enough or necessarily down the right path to improvement there is a strong need for more practical based training on energy derivatives similar to the course taught by paradigm here at enron the focus of the university teachers is quite theoretical due in large part to their background while the theoretical basis is crucial to understanding the basics the real value of such a program in my opinion is the effective bridging of the theoretical with the practical all in one course until measures are taken to inject practicality from someone with extensive industry experience i believe the energy finance program will continue to underdeliver on its objectives additionally i believe that the course structure should be changed to eliminate the need of having 3 consecutive hours of classroom instruction,0

subject eol wti historical trade simulation more profitable trading strategy please ignor my previous mail regarding the same issue which contains some typos greg and john i found that by reducing the volume per trade and increasing daily number of trades keeping the total volume per day constant we can be more profitable this is partially because in a trending market we lose less money by following the market more closely for example suppose market move from 30 to 35 if per trade volume is 10 000 bbl and the half bid offer spread is 1 for simplicity we take 5 trades of short positions the total mtm for that day is 5 4 3 2 1 10 000 150 000 and total trading volume is 50 000 bbl short if per trade volume is 50 000 bbl we take one trade the total mtm is 5 50 000 250 000 thus the net difference between the two trading strategies is 10 000 for that particular day therefore it seems that by reducing per trade volume and increasing the number of trades we can be more profitable as a market maker i rerun a scenario that stinson sent to you on dec 27 where he used per trade volume of 30 000 bbl i reduce the number of trade to 10 000 while increasing the number of trades by factor of 3 almost in all cases i saw increased profitability see the colume marked change for dollar amount change in millions please let stinson or me know your thoughts on this regards zimin lu x 36388 as compared to,0

subject vince and vasant here is a brief summary of my meeting with chris germany capacity trader at the east desk related to gas transmission typically pipelines lease capacity billed on a monthly basis an example might be the pipeline between south texas and brooklyn where you might pay 12 00 per month per 10 000 decatherms of capacity 0 40 per day a fixed payment variable charges are 6 for fuel costs shrinkage and 6 5 for overhead expenses a gas trader might call south texas and be quoted a delivery price tomorrow of nymex 0 10 basis and might call brooklyn and be quoted a delivered price of nymex 0 25 the trader s spread is 0 35 and variable costs of transmission are 0 125 so the trader would offer the leaseholder of capacity up to 0 225 for firm capacity tomorrow as for the distinction betweem firm and interruptible the leaseholders have an excellent knowledge of the firm equivalent of interruptible capacity also many pipelines don t discount firm capacity from the tariff maximum it s not worth their time to haggle there is a further issue of secondary markets not important to the model yet for south texas and brooklyn there are several different routes the gas can physically take pipelines of enron texas eastern etc and once the trade is in the system traders can cover the enron positions on each end of the pipeline in so doing freeing up the capacity for other contracts clayton,0

subject interview numerical methods finance dear tanya it was a great pleasure to have met you i very much enjoyed the interview and your insightfull questions i am keenly aware that many of the methods that i discussed with you yesterday are unique new and not reported elsewhere this is true both about the work i did in whole yield curve interest rate pricing as well as garch the innovations stem from the extensive numerical analysis experience that i have both in turbulence physics as well as finance they entailed considering the problem from its raw formulation mathematical analysis physical interpretation taylored numerical method development software writting and develoment and data management as to why i have not yet published anything the answer is that the driver in my work has been adding value to the business not publishing publishing is however an option that has always been open with my former supervisor who is aware of the work that i did i not however that these results were possible only by exploring to the utmost extent the mathematics finance software design and data managemnet aspects of the problem absence of any of these aspects is likely to cripple performance and execution please recall that as good as they were the performance measures that i mentioned to you were for a single processor machine vastly better can be achieved with both soft parallelism multithreading as well as hard parallelism heterogenous network this fo course allows us to step up the reach of the models used in fact i know for a fact that better can be done than what i mentioned in the interview from work that i have been doing on the integration of the swaption volatility surface on the whole yield curve interest rate model itm and otm instruments can be included in both the callibration pricing and hedging i look forward hearing back from you soon and particularly to the opportunity of us cooperating best regards joao,0

davids on 04 10 2000 08 35 32 pm to steven r meyers enron com cc subject re possible meeting steve i ll see if i can get in on the 25 th will let you know but i think it ll work just to give you a very brief overview so you can think about who might be interested abacus has the largest transactional database of consumer buying behavior in the world 89 million us households 3 billion purchases along with sophisticated modeling capabilities to help predict customer response to various offers at the household level given the critical need to reduce customer acquisition costs in retail energy markets we believe that our data and modeling can help energy retailers target their direct marketing efforts toward the residential customers most likely to respond to whatever the offer is improving the efficiency of mailings and other promotional campaigns so there is an efficiency angle see because our data allow the modeling of future buying behavior based on actual purchases our results tend to be significantly more predictive than demographic based models so far the the response from utilities and new entrants i ve been talking to so far has been quite positive and we have some tests of our data underway but we re interested in talking to as many players in the market as possible as we develop specific products to meet utility needs i can provide more background if desired to whoever might be interested but i guess the key immediate question is whether it might be worthwhile to arrange a short meeting sometime on the 25 th of april with whoever at enron might have interest in hearing what we re up to and most importantly listening to what your data needs might be as you enter new markets thanks very much for any help i look forward to catching up and hearing how things are going for you regards brad davids 303 410 5531 original message from steven r meyers enron com mailto steven r meyers enron com sent monday april 10 2000 12 13 pm to brad davids abacus direct com

afternoon about my inability to travel i m trying to rearrange my trip for a couple of week s time when my ear has cleared up and i look forward to meeting with you one day i wrote to vince last week asking for a favour but i m not sure ifhe is there in houston i know that you guys are probably very busy but i was wondering if you can write a few sentences for me i m sending out some sample chapters to the people who responded positively all of them to my request for some feedback on the book chapter 1 has an overview of the book with just a couple of sentences on each chapter could you please write a sentence or two for your chapter i m including what i have already written although i think it has changed slightly from this version so that you can see the style many thanks and best regards chris 2 overview of this book this book aims to provide an in depth understanding of the pricing and risk management of energy derivatives in the remainder of this chapter we give an overview of the fundamental principals needed to model and price energy assets and which underlie the rest of the book as well as introducing the techniques that underlie the black scholes modelling framework we discuss the numerical techniques of trinomial trees and monte carlo simulation for derivative pricing which are used extensively later in the book in chapter 2 we analyse spot energy prices apart from describing empirical prices we propose a number of processes that can be used to model the prices we look at the well know process of gbm as well as mean reversion stochastic volatility and jump processes discussing each and showing how they can be simulated and their parameters estimated chapter 3 written by vince kaminski grant masson and ronnie chahal of enron corporation discusses volatility estimation in energy commodity markets this chapter builds on the previous one it examines in detail the methods merits and pitfalls of the volatility estimation process assuming different pricing models introduced in chapter 2 examples from crude gas and electricity markets are used to illustrate the technical and interpretative aspects of calculating volatility chapter 4 examines forward curves in the energy markets although such curves are well understood and straight forward in the world debt markets the difficulty of storage in many energy markets leads to less well defined curves what we do in this chapter chapter 5 presents an overview of the common and not so common derivative structures in the energy markets and discusses their uses examples of products analysed in this chapter include a variety of swaps caps floors and collars as well as energy swaptions compound options asian or average rate options barriers lookbacks and ladder options chapter 6 investigates single and multi factor models of the energy spot price and the pricing of some standard energy derivatives closed form solutions for forward prices forward volatilities and european option prices are derived and presented for all the models in this chapter including a three factor stochastic convenience yield and interest rate model with jumps chapter 7 shows how the prices of path dependent and american style options can be evaluated for the models in chapter 6 simulation schemes are developed for the evaluation of european style options and applied to a variety of path dependent options in order to price options which incorporate early exercise opportunities a trinomial tree scheme is developed this tree is built to be consistent with the observed forward curve and can be used to price exotic as well as standard american style options chapter 8 develops a new methodology for valuing energy options based on modelling the market observed forward curve the approach results in a multi factor model that is able to capture realistically the evolution of a wide range of energy forward curves and where the user defined volatility structures can be of an extremely general form closed form solutions are developed for pricing standard european options and efficient monte carlo schemes for exotic options the chapter finishes with a discussion of the valuation of american style options chapter 9 focuses on the risk management of energy derivative positions in this chapter we discuss the management of price risk for institutions that sell options or other derivatives to a client and who is then faced with the problem of managing the risk through time we begin with delta hedging a portfolio containing derivatives and look at extensions to gamma hedging using the models from chapters 5 and 7 the general model of chapter 7 ideally suited to multi factor hedging and this is also discussed chapter 10 looks at the key risk management concept of value at risk applied to portfolios containing energy derivative portfolios after discussing the concept of the measure we look at how the key inputs volatilities covariances correlations etc can be estimated we then compare the fours major methodologies for computing var delta delta gamma historical simulation and monte carlo simulation finally we look at testing the var estimates for various underlying energy market

subject when will the real estate bubble burst live meeting july 21 st on alternative investments event date thursday july 21 st at 10 30 am est 2 30 pm est and 7 30 pm estwith top ranked alternative investment manager michael mansfield the biggest financial bubble in history in the article after the fall in the june 16 2005 issue of economist magazine real estate was called the biggest financial bubble in history what makes this real estate market so risky is that the crazy speculation in housing has spread around the world people continue to buy houses simply because prices are rising without any regard to fundamentals this is similar to what happened with the stock market during the 1990 s when investors bought shares of profitless companies just because everyone else was doing the same in fact many of thepeople who have gotten or are getting into real estate are the ones that got killed by the stock market during the 2000 crash consequently these will probably be the same

subject re pre submitted question on espeak erin a book by martha amram and nalin kulatilaka is an excellent non technical introduction to real options and it contains all the most important references to more advanced books and papers the book has an endorsement by jeff skilling on the cover page the research group offered several one day seminars on real options and applications to the energy industry we still have a few binders with the presentation materials available if you are interested we plan to repeat the seminar sometimes in the fall the first part of the seminar about 4 hours in the morning covers general concept of real options and their applicability to the energy business the second more technical afternoon session covers stochastic processes used to model price uncertainty in the energy markets and specific case studies valuation of natural gas storage facilities and of peaking gas fired power plants the real options approach has been developed specifically to address the problem of making investment decisions under uncertainty nobody in this field claims that this is a perfect tool but it represents a significant progress compared to other techniques developed earlier discounted cash flow analysis that tries to incorporate uncertainty through analysis of several in most cases arbitrary scenarios most likely optimistic pessimistic these scenarios don t identify explicitly the risk drivers and don t specify the future proactive management decisions the real option approach is very powerful because it allows to 1 capture uncertainty in an explicit way and 2 to design investment projects that allow to exploit future positive developments and reduce future exposures to downside risk this approach allows also create a link between investment decisions and future operational decisions forward looking investment decisions create options that are exercised in the future through active management of a project the real options technology relies heavily on advanced statistical tools to come up with the representation of future possible states of the world the real challenge is to use these tools in a sensible way i have seen in my career almost 30 years of applying mathematical tools to business and economic problems many quants armed with powerful computers who reminded me of monkeys armed with hammers the challenge is not to run mechanically thousands of simulations based on arbitrary assumptions but to translate in a creative way the insights of people who understand specific businesses into parsimonious quantitative models it is especially critical to stress test the assumptions of any model and to ask the question if the outcome of a model depends critically on any set of assumptions if this is the case one should use common sense to examine the underlying assumptions i remember that in the early eighties quite a few models simulated the dynamics of oil prices but all the stochastic scenarios represented fluctuations around a very optimistic upward trend one would have been better off stepping back and asking a simple question what economics 101 teaches about cartels and the dynamics of supply and demand enron north america corp from erin rice enron 06 27 2000 03 52 pm to vince j kaminski hou ect ect cc subject pre submitted question on espeak good news there is already a question waiting for your july 12 espeak session i have pasted it below although you don t have to respond until the actual event don t forget to send a bulleted list of discussion topics if you would still like us to advertise the event on the elevator screens thanks er submitted by breineck i was doing some reading about the application of real options in the evaluation of non financial assets would you recommend any texts or articles for a more in depth study of this area is quantification of risk or uncertainty the major challenge in using this concept can statistical tools be used with this to do a sort of sensitivity analysis,0

sending e mail seem impossible is there a catch no there is no catch just send your e mails and be on your way to financial freedom basically i send out as many of these e mails as i can then people send me cash in the mail for information that i just e mail back to them everyday i make a three minute drive to my p o box knowing that there are at least a few hundred dollars waiting for me and the best part it is completely legal just read the next few paragraphs and see what you think if you like what you read great if you don t read it again because you must have missed something as seen on national television making over a half million dollars every 6 months from your home for an investment of only 25 us dollars expense one time thanks to the computer age and the internet be a millionaire like others within a year before you say no way read the following this is the letter you ve been reading about in the news lately due to the popularity of this letter on the internet a major nightly news program recently devoted an entire show to the investigation of the program described below to see if it really can make people money the show also investigated whether or not the program was legal their findings proved once and for all that there are absolutely no laws prohibiting the participation in this program this has helped to show people that this is a simple harmless and fun way to make some extra money at home and besides even if you never got involved in the program the reports themselves are well worth the money they can help you start and advertise any business on the internet that is these reports stand alone and are beneficial to anyone wishing to do business on the internet the results of this show have been truly remarkable so many people are participating that those involved are doing much better than ever before since everyone makes more as more people try it out its been very exciting to be a part of it lately you will understand once you experience it here it is below print this now for future reference the following income opportunity is one you may be interested in taking a look at it can be started with very little investment 25 and the income return is tremendous this is a legitimate legal money making opportunity it does not require you to come into contact with people do any hard work and best of all you never have to leave your house except to get the mail simply follow the instructions and you really can make this happen this e mail order marketing program works every time if you put in the effort to make it work e mail is the sales tool of the future take advantage of this non commercialized method of advertising now the longer you wait the more savvy people will be taking your business using e mail get what is rightfully yours program yourself for success and dare to think big it sounds corny but it s true you ll never make it big if you don t have this belief system in place multi level marketing mlm has finally gained respectability it is being taught in the harvard business school and both stanford research and the wall street journal have stated that between 50 and 65 of all goods and services will be sold through multi level methods this is a multi billion dollar industry and of the 500 000 millionaires in the u s 20 100 000 made their fortune in the last several years in mlm moreover statistics show 45 people become millionaires everyday through multi level marketing you may have heard this story before but donald trump made an appearance on the david letterman show dave asked him what he would do if he lost everything and had to start over from scratch without hesitating trump said he would find a good network marketing company and get to work the audience started to hoot and boo him he looked out at the audience and dead panned his response that s why i m sitting up here and you are all sitting out there with network marketing you have two sources of income direct commissions from sales you make yourself and commissions from sales made by people you introduce to the business residual income is the secret of the wealthy it means investing time and money once and getting paid again and again and again in network marketing it also means getting paid for the work of others the enclosed information is something i almost let slip through my fingers fortunately sometime later i reread everything and gave some thought and study to it my name is jonathan rourke two years ago the corporation i worked at for the past twelve years down sized and my position was eliminated after unproductive job interviews i decided to open my own business over the past year i incurred many unforeseen financial problems i owed my family friends and creditors over 35 000 the economy was taking a toll on my business and i just couldn t seem to make ends meet i had to refinance and borrow against my home to support my family and struggling business at that moment something significant happened in my life and i am writing to share that experience in hopes that this will change your life forever financially in mid december i received this program via e mail six month s prior to receiving this program i had been sending away for information on various business opportunities all of the programs i received in my opinion were not cost effective they were either too difficult for me to comprehend or the initial investment was too much for me to risk to see if they would work or not one claimed that i would make a million dollars in one year it didn t tell me i d have to write a book to make it but like i was saying in december i received this program i didn t send for it or ask for it they just got my name off a mailing list thank goodness for that after reading it several times to make sure i was reading it correctly i couldn t believe my eyes here was a money making phenomenon i could invest as much as i wanted to start without putting me further into debt after i got a pencil and paper and figured it out i would at least get my money back but like most of you i was still a little skeptical and a little worried about the legal aspects of it all so i checked it out with the u s post office 1 800 725 2161 24 hrs and they confirmed that it is indeed legal after determining the program was legal and not a chain letter i decided why not initially i sent out 10 000 e mails it cost me about 15 for my time on line the great thing about e mail is that i don t need any money for printing to send out the program and because all of my orders are filled via e mail the only expense is my time i am telling you like it is i hope it doesn t turn you off but i promised myself that i would not rip off anyone no matter how much money it cost me here is the basic version of what you need to do your first goal is to receive at least 20 orders for report 1 within 2 weeks of your first program going out if you don t send out more programs until you do your second goal is to receive at least 150 orders for report 2 within 4 weeks if not send out more programs until you do once you have your 150 orders relax you ve met your goal you will make 50 000 but keep at it if you don t get 150 right off keep at it it may take some time for your down line to build keep at it stay focused and do not let yourself get distracted in less than one week i was starting to receive orders for report 1 i kept at it kept mailing out the program and by january 13 1 had received 26 orders for report 1 my first step in making 50 000 in 90 days was done by january 30 1 had received 196 orders for report 2 46 more than i needed so i sat back and relaxed by march 1 of my e mailing of 10 000 i received 58 000 with more coming in every day i paid off all my debts and bought a much needed new car please take time to read the attached program it will change your life forever remember it won t work if you don t try it this program does work but you must follow it exactly especially the rules of not trying to place your name in a different place it won t work you ll lose out on a lot of money in order for this program to work very fast try to meet your goal of 20 orders for report 1 and 150 orders for report 2 and you will make 50 000 or more in 90 days if you don t reach the first two goals with in four weeks relax you will still make a ton of money it may take a few months or so longer but keep mailing out the programs and stay focused that s the key i am living proof that it works if you choose not to participate in this program i am sorry it really is a great opportunity with little cost or risk to you if you choose to participate follow the program and you will be on your way to financial security if you are a fellow business owner and are in financial trouble like i was or you want to start your own business consider this a sign i did sincerely jonathan rourke p s do you have any idea what 11 700 5 bills 58 000 look like piled up on a kitchen table it s awesome a personal note from the originator of this program by the time you have read the enclosed program and reports you should have concluded that such a program and one that is legal could not have been created by an amateur let me tell you a little about myself i had a profitable business for 10 years then in 1979 my business began falling off i was doing the same things that were previously successful for me but it wasn t working finally i figured it out it wasn t me it was the economy inflation and recession had replaced the stable economy that had been with us since 1945 i don t have to tell you what happened to the unemployment rate because many of you know from first hand experience there were more failures and bankruptcies than ever before the middle class was vanishing those who knew what they were doing invested wisely and moved up those who did not including those who never had anything to save or invest were moving down into the ranks of the poor as the saying goes the rich get richer and the poor get poorer the traditional methods of making money will never allow you to move up or get rich inflation will see to that you have just received information that can give you financial freedom for the rest of your life with no risk and just a little bit of effort you can make more money in the next few months than you have ever imagined follow the program exactly as instructed do not change it in any way it works exceedingly well as it is now remember to e mail a copy of this exciting report to everyone you can think of one of the people you send this to may send out 50 000 and your name will be on everyone of them remember though the more you send out the more potential customers you will reach so my friend i have given you the ideas information materials and opportunity to become financially independent it is up to you now think about it before you delete this program from your mailbox as i almost did take a little time to read it and really think about it get a pencil and figure out what could happen when you participate figure out the worst possible response and no matter how you calculate it you will still make a lot of money you will definitely get back what you invested any doubts you have will vanish when your first orders come in it works jody jacobs richmond va here s how this amazing program will make you thousands of dollar this method of raising capital really works 100 every time i am sure that you could use up to 50 000 or more in the next 90 days before you say no way please read this program carefully this is not a chain letter but a perfectly legal money making opportunity basically this is what you do as with all multilevel businesses we build our business by recruiting new partners and selling our products every state in the usa allows you to recruit new multilevel business partners and we offer a product for every dollar sent your orders come by mail and are filled by e mail so you are not involved in personal selling you do it privately in your own home store or office this is the greatest multi level mail order marketing anywhere this is what you must do 1 order all 5 reports shown on the list below you can t sell them if you don t have them for each report send 5 00 cash the name number of the report you are ordering your e mail address and your name return address in case of a problem make sure your return address is on your envelope in case of any mail problems when you place your order make sure you order each of the five reports you need all five reports so that you can save them on your computer and resell them within a few days you will receive via e mail each of the five reports save them on your computer so they will be accessible for you to send to the 1 000 s of people who will order them from you 2 important do not alter the names of the people who are listed next to each report or their order on the list in any way other than as instructed below in steps a through g or you will lose out on the majority of your profits once you understand the way this works you ll also see how it doesn t work if you change it remember this method has been tested and if you alter it it will not work a look below for the listing of available reports b after you ve ordered the five reports take this advertisement and remove the name and address under report 5 this person has made it through the cycle and is no doubt counting their 50 000 c move the name and address under report 4 down to report 5 d move the name and address under report 3 down to report 4 e move the name and address under report 2 down to report 3 f move the name and address under report 1 down to report 2 g insert your name and address in the report 1 position please make sure you copy every name and address accurately copy and paste method works well 3 take this entire letter including the modified list of names and save it to your computer make no changes to the instruction portion of this letter your cost to participate in this is practically nothing surely you can afford 25 you obviously already have an internet connection and e mail is free to assist you with marketing your business on the internet the 5 reports you purchase will provide you with invaluable marketing information which includes how to send bulk e mails where to find thousands of free classified ads and much much more here are two primary methods of building your downline method 1 sending bulk e mail let s say that you decide to start small just to see how it goes and we ll assume you and all those involved send out only 2 000 programs each let s also assume that the mailing receives a 0 5 response using a good list the response could be much better also many people will send out hundreds of thousands of programs instead of 2 000 but continuing with this example you send out only 2 000 programs with a 0 5 response that is only 10 orders for report 1 those 10 people respond by sending out 2 000 programs each for a total of 20 000 out of those 0 5 100 people respond and order report 2 those 100 mail out 2 000 programs each for a total of 200 000 the 0 5 response to that is 1 000 orders for report 3 those 1 000 send out 2 000 programs each for a 2 000 000 total the 0 5 response to that is i 0 000 orders for report 4 that amounts to 10 000 each of 5 bills for you in cash money then think about level five that s 500 000 alone your total income in this example is 50 500 5 000 50 000 500 000 for a total of 555 550 remember friend this is assuming 1 990 out of the 2 000 people you mail to will do absolutely nothing and trash this program dare to think for a moment what would happen if everyone or half sent out 100 000 programs instead of 2 000 believe me many people will do just that and more report 2 will show you the best methods for bulk e mailing and e mail software method 2 placing free ads on the internet 1 advertising on the net is very very inexpensive and there are hundreds of free places to advertise let s say you decide to start small just to see how well it works assume your goal is to get only 10 people to participate on your first level placing a lot of free ads on the internet will easily get a larger response also assume that everyone else in your organization gets only 10 downline members follow this example to achieve the staggering results below lst level your 10 members with 5 50 2 nd level 10 members from those 10 5 x 100 500 3 rd level 10 members from those 100 5 x 1 000 5 000 4 th level 10 members from those 1 000 5 x 10 k 50 000 5 th level 10 members from those 10 000 5 x 100 k 500 000 this totals 555 550 remember friends this assumes that the people who participate only recruit 10 people each think for a moment what would happen if they got 20 people to participate most people get 100 s of participants think about it for every 5 00 you receive all you must do is e mail them the report they ordered that s it always provide same day service on all orders this will guarantee that the e mail they send out with your name and address on it will be prompt because they can t advertise until they receive the report available reports order each report by number and name always send 5 cash u s currency for each report checks not accepted always send your order via first class mail make sure the cash is concealed by wrapping it in at least two sheets of paper so that the bill can t be seen against light on one of those sheets of paper include a the number name of the report you are ordering b your e mail address and c your name postal address in case your e mail provider encounters problems place your order for these reports now report 1 the insiders guide

jody and i live in chicago il i am a cost accountant with a major u s corporation and i make pretty good money when i received the program i grumbled to jody about receiving junk mail i made fun of the whole thing spouting my knowledge of the population and percentages involved i knew it wouldn t work jody totally ignored my supposed intelligence and jumped in with both feet i made merciless fun of her and was ready to lay the old i told you so on her when the thing didn t work well the laugh was on me within two weeks she had received over 50 responses within 45 days she had received over 147 200 in 5 bills i was shocked i was sure that i had it all figured and that it wouldn t work i am a believer now i have joined jody in her hobby i did have seven more years until retirement but i think of the rat race and it s not for me we owe it all to mlm mitchell wolf md chicago il the main reason for this letter is to convince you that this system is honest lawful extremely profitable and is a way to get a large amount of money in a short time i was approached several times before 1 checked this out i joined just to see what one could expect in return for the minimal effort and money required to my astonishment i received 36 470 00 in the first 14 weeks with money still coming in charles morris esq not being the gambling type it took me several weeks to make up my mind to participate in this plan but conservative that i am i decided that the initial investment was so little that there was just no way that i wouldn t get enough orders to at least get my money back boy

to pbxs to firewalls but what of the open source hacker  s dream of  linux on every desktop  8 sure linux on the desktop has become more accessible than ever with colorful shrink wrapped boxes of caldera red hat and corel linux now available at places like compusa however analysts have said that linux  s growth in the enterprise will be limited to the macro and micro areas of network servers and embedded operating systems according to idc linux currently runs on only 4 of u s desktops the hold microsoft windows has on the desktop market will remain strong analysts say despite such factors as microsoft  s antitrust problems and the surging popularity of linux even some linux executives are skeptical of their product  s desktop future recently suse ceo roland dyroff downplayed linux  s future on desktops dyroff said  given the lack of applications available we really can t claim it as being competitive on the desktop yet  8 a recent survey by survey com gives more hope for linux desktops according to the survey of 1 640 enterprise network managers open source operating systems are used on 10 of desktops with the number jumping to a surprising 23 of enterprise desktops by 2002 despite the mix of numbers being thrown around two important factors that will determine the success of linux as an enterprise client desktop are a standardized easy to use graphical user interface gui and available applications one company that is working to make linux more user friendly is palo alto based eazel which is designing a next generation file management system and user interface to run on top of the linux kernel according to eazel  s web site the company  s goal is to bring linux to the masses and  do it in a way that appeals to today s linux users and to mere mortals  8 the company was founded by a group of former apple executives and is allied with the gnome project which has been doing extensive linux desktop environment development for several years eazel is due to have a product out by the middle of this year with an intuitive icon based file management environment eazel is hoping its user interface will be an improvement over the two current linux guis gnome and kde and will help standardized the look and feel of linux for  regular  8 users for enterprise mangers who have already embraced linux on the server side this development will be worth keeping an eye on on the applications side several office productivity suites have been available for some time such as sun  s staroffice suite and koffice for the kde desktop corel has also ported its office products such as wordperfect over to linux to complement its own distribution of the operating system while there have been recent rumors started by linux care vice president arthur tyde that microsoft is working on a port of ms office to linux microsoft officials deny this while linux may never supplant windows as the industry standard desktop there should be plenty of opportunity for

subject full circle asps the new big blue network world fusion focus mike jude and nancy meachim on application service providers today s focus full circle asps the new big blue 03 15 00 dear wincenty kaminski today s focus full circle asps the new big blue by mike jude and nancy meachim the terms  asp  8 and  ibm  8 may have more in common than being three letter acronyms remember big blue of the early  60 s the vision then was centralized computing mainframe computers hosted complex expensive applications that end users accessed via dumb terminals it infrastructure especially memory was expensive and needed to be controlled with computing resources centralized ibm reasoned they were easier to maintain of course ibm got it wrong in that computers became a cheap commodity and users weren  t happy simply using dumb terminals they wanted a bigger share in all that technology offered so as memory prices fell so did the idea of central control dumb terminals were transformed into intelligent desktop machines that could store applications and data the glass house populated by white smocked technicians went out of fashion looking back on those times many of us would shake our heads and wonder how ibm could have been so wrong but maybe big blue wasn  t so far off thanks to the advent of application service providers centralized computing is making a comeback asps offer centralized application management the market started as a way to offer the benefits of server advertisement protocol and other complex enterprise resource planning software to small companies or companies with less technical savvy but asps now host all kinds of applications including small multilicensed programs whose images are downloaded to end users on demand but the principle remains the same central control makes support much more efficient and usually cheaper how about that ibm to be fair the dynamics of an asp are very different from old centralized mainframe operations an asp doesn  t just host and support an application for general distribution over an in house proprietary network unlike the ibm vision an asp is very dependent on network service it is also very sensitive to service levels in the  60 s if the mainframe let you down you ended up twiddling your thumbs for an hour or so and your only recourse was that white smocked fellow nowadays users start to scream if service is interrupted for even a minute and woe to the asp who brings down a customer operation the world of the asp is much more complex than that of the old  60 s shop however if one could magically transport a computer user from the  60 s to the wonderful new 2000 s would it seem all that different to him in an ideal asp world a la scott mcnealy  s vision users would sit down at a semidumb terminal download the application du jour and start working what did the  60 s user do kind of the same thing so you are probably wondering what is the point just this ibm  s problem was leaving the customer out of the equation and look what happened customers rebelled they didn  t buy ibm  s spiel it became the  in  8 thing to hate ibm why because the guys in white smocks couldn  t spell service and didn  t care about customers to be successful asps need to learn from the past they need to tattoo service on the forehead of each of their employees there are too many choices today for customers to put up with inferior service that  s one big difference from the  60 s customers now can literally choose any service provider in the world just being big doesn  t cut it

subject the storage revolution has begun network world fusion focus amy larsen decarlo on storage in the enterprise today s focus the storage revolution has begun 03 07 00 dear wincenty kaminski today s focus the storage revolution has begun by amy larsen decarlo believe the hype we are in the middle of a storage revolution virtually overnight businesses have gone from storing gigabytes to terabytes of data and the number of users accessing that information is skyrocketing the subsequent requirements are forcing companies to rethink their storage strategies and to recognize the importance of storage management in the equation of efficient information delivery it isn  t just the volume of data or the higher scalability demands that are changing how businesses handle storage the premium that companies place on much of their enterprise information is having a profound effect on their storage requirements businesses demand fault tolerant storage systems that deliver swift and reliable data access to their employees suppliers and customers but given the fact that hard disk capacity requirements on average double every 12 months while processor speeds double every 18 months companies are left with a quandary how can they manage the proliferation of stored information efficiently enough to compensate for the differential between capacity requirements and processor speeds the simple answer to this question is to institute a well executed storage management plan that anticipates capacity requirements in advance and leverages the best technologies and techniques to support those needs bear in mind that the majority of storage costs come not from the equipment but from the implementation and support of those systems there are several ways to efficiently manage storage one of the best routes is consolidation that is pooling resources and managing storage as a system as opposed to a decentralized collection of file servers this may sound like a throwback to an earlier era when enterprise storage resided on mainframes but it  s actually a progressive step as the consolidation has more to do with centralizing the planning management and ongoing support of storage systems than it does with the physical location of the files next it is important to recognize that not all information is equally important to the organization consequently storage requirements vary by business application as in all areas of it it is important to make storage implementation decisions based on business needs businesses trying to more efficiently manage storage are looking for alternatives to the distributed file server storage model they want to speed access to stored files and remove bandwidth intensive backup and recovery operations from the lan network attached storage nas supplies it professionals with one answer giving workstations and servers a way to gain direct access to stored data nas devices which have been widely available for years are optimized to process i o transactions though they promise better performance they don  t remove backups from the transport network instead they supply a relatively easy to deploy solution to cross platform storage problems for most heterogeneous environments many consider storage area networks san to be the best long term answer to current and future storage challenges because sans are designed with a topology separate from the corporate data network they alleviate many of the availability and performance issues associated with more traditional storage models yet given the early deployment stage most companies are still in many of those capabilities are still largely untested in a production environment this newsletter will examine how through effective storage management it professionals can reduce support costs and improve service delivery to their customers this newsletter will not focus on items like the least expensive tape drive or the fast tape library instead it will look at how businesses can reduce inefficiencies and leverage emerging technologies to resolve their particular storage application issues ultimately the goal is to identify storage technology

subject re marketpoint license agreement john fyi vince forwarded by vince j kaminski hou ect on 11 27 2000 03 31 pm dale m nesbitt on 11 27 2000 02 51 54 pm please respond to to cc subject re marketpoint license agreement vince i will send you our contract for the week long engagement the way we do it is send out our time and materials contract which has a space for individual task statements i then put in a task statement for the week long project at the 12 k level so that the costs and risks are capped for you look for it in the next day or two with regard to the long run and short run gas models they are both implemented in the same software system neither is a prerequisite for running the other but both operate the same way and the sum of the two consumes approximately the same resources are either individually i plan to have an extended visit in houston beginning one week from today and lasting through the following wednesday intensively tutoring my daughter for her first semester economics finals at rice she certainly should have gotten a better looking tutor that will make it very easy to come by and finalize whatever needs to be finalized with you that week with her in houston i spend a good bit of time there look for the stuff in the next day or two i look forward to working with you and your colleagues thanks dale original message from vince j kaminski enron com mailto vince j kaminski enron com sent monday november 27 2000 10 44 am to dale nesbitt worldnet att net cc vince j kaminski enron com subject re marketpoint license agreement dale thanks for your message in our phone conversation before the meeting you mentioned another contractual arrangement under which we could work with your company employees on a case study the cost of a weekly project would be 12 000 that would be applied to the purchase price should we go ahead and decide to acquire the software this project would allow us to evaluate the model and come up with an estimate of the manpower necessary to support the model internally please let me know more about this option we are primarily interested in a long term natural gas model and the database for north america unless a familiarity with the short term model is a prerequisite we don t have resources to spend too much time on it of course a trading desk may be interested in the short term version of the model i shall talk to them about it vince dale m nesbitt on 11 13 2000 06 00 05 pm to vince j kaminski cc subject marketpoint license agreement john vince i really enjoyed the meeting the other day with you and a broad cross section of your people thank you very much for setting it up and thank you for giving me the opportunity to speak with your people as i mentioned to john i am sending you the license paperwork for marketpoint i have attached our standard license agreement for your consideration as i mentioned the license agreement covers the entire bundled product which includes north american gas short and long term north american electricity short and long term world gas western european gas world oil we are just finishing porting the world oil world gas and western european gas models over from our old now obsolete software system into marketpoint so they will not be fully tested and complete for a couple of months however the gas and electricity models for north america are presently complete and tested that should allow us to give you an attractive price before the full worldwide toolkit is available throughout your worldwide business as i understood it you will want the gas modeling capability first and will want to defer decisions on electric or other capability as i mentioned at the meeting we are prepared to offer that for approximately the fully bundled price as you read the license agreement you will see that the software licenses for 100 000 annually the gas data for 5 000 and the electric data for 10 000 marketpoint will agree to license you the gas model plus the data for the software license plus the data license for a total of 55 000 annually this is just under the fully bundled price i think that is consistent with the discussions at our meeting and from marketpoint s perspective would provide a great basis to move forward together with enron if or when enron ever desires to scale up to another model or model s from the marketpoint portfolio we will simply scale you up to the entire license agreement this will allow you to decouple the gas decision from any other decisions you might make i will be glad to put this additional pricing provision into the agreement if you decide to move forward i felt i was able to communicate the philosophy scope and operation of our approach during the meeting and to deliver you much of the information you might need to evaluate whether marketpoint meets your needs i thought you were able to see the depth and sophistication of the product yet at the same time its simplicity and effectiveness i thought you were able to see the benefits of the marketpoint dimension of economic equilibrium as a complement and supplement to other approaches you will assuredly use i would be interested in your impressions and those of your colleagues i look forward to your response and to moving ahead together we view you as a very important prospective customer and client and will work with you to earn and secure your business if you decide to license marketpoint we can arrange to transfer and mount marketpoint and the short term narg model which is the model we suggest you begin with and travel to houston to deliver our 1 day training seminar our clients are usually very fluent after that 1 day training seminar thereafter we would want you to work with the short term narg model for a few weeks while you get up to speed very fluent and very comfortable before you take delivery of the longer term version of narg several weeks later thanks again and all the best
